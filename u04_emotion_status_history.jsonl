It\u2019s Sunday night now, and I\u2019m already feeling that familiar knot in my stomach thinking about everything that\u2019s coming up. I mean, I *know* I\u2019ve been getting good sleep, and my stamina feels fine, which is great, but it\u2019s like my brain just can\u2019t keep up with everything else.\n\nAcademically, I\u2019m really starting to worry about COSC 065. I saw the summary said \"no class experience recorded,\" and yeah, that\u2019s pretty accurate. I had classes scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, all at lsb, but I just\u2026 wasn't there. I don't know what happened. I was at Sphinx a lot, and then Reed Hall at weird hours, but not lsb. It\u2019s like I just completely lost track, or maybe I just couldn't bring myself to go. It\u2019s such a bad habit, and now I\u2019m so far behind. The thought of catching up is just overwhelming, especially with *so many* deadlines looming for Monday and Tuesday. It\u2019s like a wall of assignments, and I haven\u2019t even started on most of them. I feel this intense pressure, and it just makes me want to curl up and disappear.\n\nOutside of classes, I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time at the Sphinx Secret Society building. Sometimes I\u2019m doing things there, sometimes I\u2019m just\u2026 there. It\u2019s a comfortable place, I guess. And my pottery studio trips to Vermont have been a consistent thing, which is nice. It\u2019s a good escape, a place where I can actually focus on something tangible and not feel like my brain is constantly buzzing with anxieties. I also managed to get to the Boathouse a few times, and the gym. It feels good to move, to just push myself physically when my mind feels so stuck. I guess that\u2019s why my stamina is still high, even if my mental state feels a bit fragile.\n\nSocially, I feel a bit disconnected. I\u2019m around people, especially at Sphinx, but it\u2019s not always deep connection, you know? It\u2019s more like just existing in the same space. I probably need to make more of an effort to actually *talk* to people, but when I\u2019m this stressed about academics, it\u2019s hard to put myself out there.\n\nThe biggest challenge, by far, is getting back on track with COSC 065. It\u2019s not just the missed classes, it\u2019s the feeling of falling behind and the sheer volume of work that needs to be done. I feel this immense guilt, and it just spirals into more anxiety.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear, even if they feel daunting:\n1.  **Attend COSC 065 classes.** No excuses. I need to be there, even if I feel lost. Just showing up is the first step.\n2.  **Tackle those Monday and Tuesday deadlines.** I need to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks. Maybe I can find someone in class to ask for help, even though that thought makes me a bit nervous.\n3.  **Prioritize academic work over other activities.** As much as I love pottery and the boathouse, I need to put my studies first right now.\n4.  **Try to reach out to someone.** Maybe a classmate, or even just a friend, to talk about how overwhelmed I\u2019m feeling. Keeping it all inside isn't helping.\n\nI just hope I can actually follow through.

I know I had classes scheduled, but I just\u2026 didn't make it. Every time Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday rolled around, I had every intention of going to lsb, but then I found myself elsewhere. On Wednesday and Friday mornings, I was at Sphinx, and Thursday I was at the gym. Monday, same thing, back at Sphinx. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t *know* the material, I actually feel pretty good about my understanding of things, but showing up is a whole other battle. And now, looking at all these deadlines piling up for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, it\u2019s just making my anxiety spike even higher. I *need* to get on top of this. It\u2019s not fair to myself, or to the professors, to just skip out.\n\nOutside of classes, my week was a blur of activity, but not necessarily the kind that makes me feel connected. The boathouse was my constant. I was there almost every day, sometimes multiple times a day, just pushing myself. It\u2019s exhausting, but it\u2019s also the one place where I feel like I\u2019m actually *doing* something productive and physical. My stamina is high, so at least I'm not physically drained from that, but mentally, it's a lot.\n\nThen there\u2019s Sphinx. I spent so much time there, especially late into the night. It feels like a second home, but even with all that time, my social battery still feels low. I\u2019m around people, but I don\u2019t always feel *with* them, if that makes sense. It\u2019s weird. And then, Friday night, I actually made it out to the pottery studio. That was a nice escape, just getting my hands dirty and focusing on something completely different. It\u2019s off-campus, which is a bit of a trek, but it\u2019s a good way to clear my head, even if it\u2019s just for a few hours.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was definitely my inability to get to COSC 065. It\u2019s a pattern I need to break. I feel so overwhelmed by everything, and it just makes me want to retreat, even though I know that\u2019s not helping. My sleep has been good, which is a blessing, but it doesn't seem to be translating into feeling rested or less anxious during the day.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear, even if they feel daunting. First, I *have* to prioritize those deadlines. I need to break them down and tackle them one by one, instead of letting them loom over me. Second, I need to figure out how to actually get to my COSC 065 classes. Maybe I need to set alarms, or find a study buddy to walk with. I need to be more intentional about my academic commitments. And finally, I need to find a way to manage this constant feeling of being on edge. Maybe spending less time at Sphinx and more time just\u2026 being quiet, or doing something that genuinely recharges me, like pottery, could help.

I saw the schedule, I know when it was supposed to be, but every time, I just found myself somewhere else. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday \u2013 all those class times, and I was either still in my dorm or, more often, at the Sphinx Secret Society. I don\u2019t even know why I keep ending up there.

I guess I\u2019m just trying to find places to be that aren\u2019t my dorm or the library, but also aren\u2019t class.\n\nIt\u2019s a mess.

It's like I'm moving through the world, but not really connecting with anyone.\n\nThe biggest thing weighing on me is COSC 065. I know I have classes for it, but I just\u2026 didn't make it. Not once. Every time the alarm went off, or I thought about getting ready, this wave of dread would just wash over me. It felt impossible to drag myself out of bed, or even out of my dorm, to face it. I know the material, I really do, but the thought of actually *being there* felt overwhelming. And now, looking at the upcoming deadlines, it's just a huge knot in my stomach. So many things due on Monday, then Tuesday, and Wednesday. How am I going to catch up when I can barely function?\n\nI spent a lot of time at the Boathouse this week. It's a place where I can just be, I guess. Sometimes I'd do something, sometimes I'd just sit there. It's a bit of an escape. But my real escape, the one place I feel like I can breathe, is the pottery studio. I was there so much, especially late at night. It's off campus, and it's just... quiet. I can lose myself in what I'm doing, and for a few hours, the anxiety just fades. But then I look at the clock, and it's 1 AM, 2 AM, even 3 AM, and I know I'm just digging myself deeper into this sleep deficit. I was even at Fairchild and Reed Hall super late, trying to get some work done when no one else was around. It feels like the only time I can focus, but it's clearly not sustainable.\n\nI know I need to get my act together.

And I really, really need to prioritize sleep. That means cutting back on the late-night pottery sessions, even though it's the one thing that brings me some peace.

I completely missed my COSC 065 classes on Wednesday and Thursday. I feel so bad about it. It's not like I don't understand the material, but actually getting myself there, especially when I'm feeling so overwhelmed, just feels impossible sometimes.

A lot of it was at Topliff, just trying to exist, or at the Sphinx Secret Society. It's good to be around people, I guess, and my social battery feels pretty full, which is a relief. I also found myself down at the Boathouse a couple of times, which was nice, just to clear my head a bit. The highlight, though, was definitely getting off campus to that pottery studio on Wednesday night. It was such a weird, unexpected detour, but it was genuinely calming to just focus on something creative for a bit, away from everything. It's a strange contrast, feeling so creatively fulfilled in one moment and then immediately crashing back into the reality of all the academic pressure.\n\nI think my sleep schedule is completely out of whack too. I was up super late on Wednesday night, then active again really early on Thursday. It's probably not helping with the general feeling of being on edge.

It's not just a task manager; it's a *supportive tool*. This niche focus makes it unique enough for a student project.\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    *   Absolutely. The student articulates the problem of student overwhelm and the counter-intuitive stress caused by traditional task managers with clarity and personal resonance. This is a highly relatable and significant pain point for the target audience.\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    *   Yes, the proposed core features (UI/UX, hierarchical task management, local notifications, simple animations, local data persistence) are all fundamental concepts covered in a typical smartphone programming course. The student has wisely avoided overly complex integrations or real-time systems, making it very achievable.\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    *   The scope is perfectly balanced. It's more than a trivial \"to-do list\" due to the hierarchical breakdown, custom notification styles, and positive reinforcement elements, which add depth. However, it remains highly feasible within a semester, as confirmed by the student's clear understanding of core mobile development concepts. The inclusion of \"Future Enhancements\" further demonstrates a mature understanding of project scoping.\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    *   This is arguably the strongest aspect of the proposal. The entire concept is built around enhancing the user's emotional state and reducing stress. Every feature, from the calming UI to the gentle reminders and micro-win celebrations, is directly tied to improving the user's experience and fostering a positive impact on their well-being. This shows a deep empathy for the user.\n\n**Overall:** This is a highly commendable project idea. It's well-researched, clearly articulated, technically sound, and demonstrates a strong user-centric approach. The student has clearly put significant thought into all aspects of the evaluation criteria.\n\n29/30"}, "weekly_desc": "This week felt like a complete blur, honestly.
