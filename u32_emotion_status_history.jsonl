It's interesting to look back and see where the time actually went, especially when the schedule feels so packed.\n\nThis week felt... different. I definitely got a lot of sleep, which is great, and my stamina feels really high. I think that's largely thanks to all the time I spent at the Boathouse. Seriously, it felt like my second home this week. From early mornings to late evenings, I was there, either actively doing something or just hanging out. There were a few \"activity\" spikes there, which were probably some really intense practice sessions or maybe even a friendly competition. It's such a great way to stay active and clear my head, and I really enjoy the social aspect of it too. It definitely contributed to my social meter being at a decent level, even if it wasn't always traditional \"socializing.\"\n\nThe flip side of that, though, is that my class attendance took a hit. Looking at my schedule, I pretty much missed all my classes this week \u2013 MATH 023, COSC 069, and COSC 065. I know, I know. It wasn't intentional to skip them all, but one thing led to another, and the Boathouse just kept calling. I was in Sudikoff a few times, and even LSC, but not during my actual class times. It's a bit of a wake-up call, honestly. My knowledge meter is still at 50, but I know that's going to drop if I keep this up.\n\nI did manage to get out a bit for some fun, like hitting up the Nugget Arcade on Sunday, which was a blast. And of course, the dining hall was a constant presence \u2013 gotta eat! But the academic side definitely needs some serious attention.\n\nThe biggest challenge staring me down right now is the sheer number of deadlines coming up. There are so many due on Friday, and then more on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. It's a bit overwhelming when I haven't been in class to keep track of everything. I'm feeling pretty good physically, and my happiness is stable, but I can feel that little conscientious voice in my head getting louder about all the work I need to catch up on.\n\nSo, for next week, my goals are crystal clear:\n1.  **Attend all my classes.** No excuses. I need to be in Kemeny, Sudikoff, and LSB when I'm supposed to be.\n2.  **Prioritize academics.** I need to figure out what I missed, catch up on readings, and start chipping away at those assignments. I'll probably spend a lot more time in Sudikoff actually *doing* CS work.\n3.  **Balance Boathouse time.** I love being there, but I need to make sure it doesn't completely derail my studies again. Maybe I can shift some of my Boathouse time to later in the day or consolidate it.\n4.  **Proactively manage deadlines.** I'm going to map out all those upcoming due dates and create a solid plan to tackle them.\n\nIt was a week of high energy and good social vibes, but definitely a learning experience on the academic front.

It's tough when practices are so demanding and sometimes run right into or through class times. I did manage to get some work done in Sudikoff on Thursday and Friday afternoons, which was good for COSC, and I even pulled a late one there on Thursday night. And I was in the Life Sciences Center for a bit on Wednesday, so I wasn't *completely* off campus. But the actual lecture time? Yeah, that was a miss.\n\nI can feel it in my knowledge levels, especially for some of the newer concepts. While my general understanding is still decent, there are definitely gaps forming in specific areas, probably from those missed COSC and Math lectures. It's a bit concerning, especially with so many deadlines piling up. I've got a whole bunch of assignments due across all my classes in the coming days and weeks, and I really need to get on top of them.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is to get back on track academically. I need to:\n1.  **Prioritize class attendance:** I'm going to make a conscious effort to be in every lecture, even if it means adjusting my pre- or post-practice routine.\n2.  **Catch up on missed material:** I'll dedicate specific blocks of time to review the lectures I missed this week, especially for MATH 023 and COSC 065. I'll hit up office hours if I need to.\n3.  **Tackle those deadlines:** I'm going to map out all the upcoming assignments and start chipping away at them early. No more last-minute rushes!\n4.  **Maintain the balance:** While academics are crucial, I also want to keep up with my athletic commitments and social life. It's all about finding that sweet spot where I can excel in everything without burning out.\n\nI'm feeling optimistic about next week. I know I can get caught up, and I'm ready to put in the work.

Seriously, it felt like my second home this week, and sometimes even my first! There were so many early mornings and late nights there, especially Thursday, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday. It was intense, but honestly, I wouldn't trade those moments for anything. The team dynamic is just incredible, and pushing ourselves like that, even at 1 AM or 3 AM, really builds something special. It's probably why my stamina and sleep stats are so high \u2013 I'm getting good rest when I do sleep, and the activity keeps me feeling strong.\n\nHowever, this intense focus on the Boathouse did come with a significant trade-off. I noticed that I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. My schedule had MATH 023, COSC 069, and COSC 065, but during those times, I was either at the Commons, the Boathouse, or even back in my dorm. It's a bit of a wake-up call, especially with so many deadlines looming. I've got a ton of assignments due across all my courses \u2013 practically every day next week has something, from Friday to Tuesday. My knowledge stats are a bit concerning, and I know missing lectures isn't helping that. It's a challenge to balance this deep commitment to the team with my academic responsibilities.\n\nOn the social front, things are fantastic. Spending so much time at the Commons for meals, and the general camaraderie around campus, has kept my social battery fully charged.

It\u2019s a good problem to have, I guess \u2013 being happy and engaged \u2013 but not at the expense of my studies.\n\nThe upcoming deadlines are staring me down, and there are quite a few of them across the next week or so. That\u2019s a clear sign I need to shift gears.\n\nSo, for next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize Class Attendance:** No more excuses. I need to be in Kemeny for Math and LSB for COSC 065, and obviously back in Sudikoff for COSC 069. I'll set extra alarms and make sure I'm heading straight there.\n2.  **Dedicated Study Time:** I need to block out specific chunks of time each day for focused work, especially for the material I missed. I'll probably head to Sudikoff or the library to really buckle down.\n3.  **Proactive Deadline Management:** With so many deadlines coming up, I need to map them all out and start chipping away at them early. No last-minute rushes!\n4.  **Balance:** While I love being social and active, I need to find a better balance. Maybe fewer long hangouts at the Commons during prime study hours, or scheduling my Boathouse time more strategically.\n\nI\u2019m feeling really positive about turning this around. I know I can do it, and I\u2019m excited to get back on track academically while still enjoying everything else campus has to offer. It\u2019s all about finding that sweet spot.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina:** 95 - The student states, \"My energy levels are through the roof\" and \"I'm feeling pretty fantastic overall,\" indicating high physical and mental energy for various activities.\n- **Knowledge:** 15 - The student explicitly states, \"My knowledge score is definitely reflecting that lack of classroom time,\" having missed most classes (Math, COSC 065) and only attended one (COSC 069).\n- **Stress:** 65 - While generally positive, the student acknowledges, \"The upcoming deadlines are staring me down, and there are quite a few of them,\" indicating a clear and present source of academic pressure that needs addressing.\n- **Happy:** 95 - The student repeatedly expresses high spirits, stating, \"I'm feeling pretty fantastic overall,\" and \"It\u2019s a good problem to have, I guess \u2013 being happy and engaged.\"\n- **Sleep:** 95 - The student directly reports, \"I've been sleeping really well,\" suggesting restful and sufficient sleep.\n- **Social:** 98 - The student's \"social battery is definitely fully charged\" and they spent \"a ton of time at the Commons\" and \"connecting with so many people,\" highlighting extensive and fulfilling social engagement."}

This week felt\u2026 interesting. On the one hand, I'm feeling fantastic! My energy levels are through the roof, I've been sleeping like a log, and my social battery is absolutely buzzing. Seriously, I feel so connected with everyone, and it's been great just being out and about. My stamina is super high too, which is always a plus.\n\nNow, for the academic side of things. This week was a bit\u2026 unconventional, I guess you could say. Looking back, I didn't actually make it to any of my scheduled classes \u2013 MATH 023, COSC 069, or COSC 065. It's not like me to miss lectures, especially with how organized I usually am. I think I just got really caught up in the flow of things, you know? There was so much going on socially, and I found myself spending a lot of time at the Class of 1953 Commons, just hanging out and grabbing meals with friends. It's such a vibrant spot, and it's easy to lose track of time when you're having good conversations.\n\nI also spent a significant amount of time down at the Dartmouth College Boathouse. I love being by the water, and it's a great place to clear my head or just enjoy the atmosphere. I even popped into The Works Caf\u00e9 on Thursday afternoon, which was a nice change of scenery. It was a good spot to just chill for a bit. I guess I was prioritizing a lot of the real-world connections and experiences this week.\n\nMy knowledge level is sitting at 65, which isn't terrible, but it's definitely something I need to focus on improving, especially after missing classes. I know I can catch up on the material, and I'm already thinking about how to structure my time more effectively next week.\n\nSpeaking of which, the sheer number of upcoming deadlines is a bit daunting, but I'm not stressed about it. I've got a plan forming in my head. There are so many due dates scattered across Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday \u2013 it's a full calendar!\n\n**Challenges this week:** Definitely the class attendance. It's a bit of a wake-up call. While I loved the social aspect and feeling so connected, I need to make sure I'm balancing that with my academic responsibilities. It's not that I wasn't engaged with learning, but the formal structure of lectures just didn't happen for me this week.\n\n**Goals for next week:**\n1.  **Get back into the classroom routine:** I need to make sure I'm physically present for all my lectures. I learn best when I'm there, engaging with the professors and my peers.\n2.  **Catch up on missed material:** I'll dedicate specific blocks of time to review the content from the classes I missed this week. I'll probably hit up office hours if I have any questions.\n3.  **Tackle those deadlines systematically:** With so many assignments coming up, I'll map them all out and break them down into manageable chunks. My conscientiousness is kicking in, and I'm ready to get organized.\n4.  **Maintain the balance:** I want to keep up this amazing feeling of happiness, social connection, and high energy. It's about integrating my academics into my life without sacrificing the well-being I've built up. I know I can do both!\n\nOverall, it was a week of high spirits and strong social connections, and while my academic presence in lectures was minimal, I'm feeling positive and ready to dive back in with full force next week. It's all about learning and adapting!", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina:** The student explicitly states, \"My energy levels are through the roof\" and \"My stamina is super high too,\" indicating exceptionally high physical and mental energy.\n- **Knowledge:** The student directly quantifies their knowledge level, stating, \"My knowledge level is sitting at 65, which isn't terrible, but it's definitely something I need to focus on improving, especially after missing classes.\"\n- **Stress:** Despite acknowledging \"the sheer number of upcoming deadlines is a bit daunting,\" the student clearly states, \"but I'm not stressed about it.

Honestly, I'm feeling really good right now. My energy levels are high, I'm sleeping well, and I've been able to connect with friends, which always boosts my mood. It feels like I'm in a really good rhythm, which is super helpful with everything going on.\n\nAcademically, it was a solid week. I was in all my classes \u2013 MATH 023, COSC 069, and COSC 065 \u2013 and while nothing particularly dramatic or standout happened, I felt really engaged. In MATH, we're starting to get into some pretty complex topics, and I'm really trying to dig deep and understand the underlying principles, not just memorize formulas. It's challenging, but in a good way \u2013 it makes me want to explore different ways of thinking about the problems. COSC 069 is always a blast, and I enjoyed the discussions we had, even if it felt like we were just building foundational knowledge. And COSC 065 is definitely pushing me to think differently, which I appreciate. I know my knowledge scores are still relatively low, but that just means there's so much more to learn, and I'm genuinely excited about that.\n\nCampus life felt vibrant, as usual. I spent a good amount of time in Kemeny and Sudikoff for classes, and LSB too. It's always nice to walk around and just soak in the atmosphere. I made sure to take some breaks and just enjoy being outside when I could.\n\nSocially, it was a great week too. I made sure to carve out time to hang out with friends, whether it was grabbing a meal or just chatting between classes. It\u2019s so important to have those connections, and I really value the people around me. We even managed to get some group study time in for COSC, which was productive and fun. It\u2019s always easier to tackle tough problems when you\u2019re bouncing ideas off each other.\n\nAs for challenges, I wouldn't say there were any major roadblocks this week, which is a relief. The biggest thing on my mind is definitely the sheer volume of upcoming deadlines. Looking at the list, it's a bit daunting \u2013 there are so many things due in the next couple of weeks across all my courses. It\u2019s not stressful in a bad way, more like a big puzzle to organize and conquer. I want to make sure I'm not just completing assignments, but truly mastering the material.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Proactive Planning:** I need to sit down and map out all those deadlines. I want to break down each assignment into smaller, manageable chunks and schedule dedicated time for them. I'm thinking of using my planner even more rigorously.\n2.  **Deep Dive into Concepts:** Especially for MATH and COSC 065, I want to spend extra time reviewing lecture notes and textbook chapters. I want to make sure I'm not just keeping up, but really understanding the 'why' behind everything. Maybe even try some extra practice problems beyond what's assigned.\n3.  **Maintain Balance:** Even with the academic push, I want to make sure I continue prioritizing my sleep, social connections, and overall well-being. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the grind, but I know staying balanced is key to performing my best. I'll definitely keep those social meet-ups on the calendar!\n\nOverall, feeling positive and ready to tackle whatever comes next.

Your high conscientiousness is evident in the detailed breakdown, and your desire to connect people and solve a common problem shines through.\n\nHere's my evaluation of \"Dartmouth Brainwave\" based on the criteria:\n\n*   **Is the idea innovative or unique compared to existing apps?**\n    While the broad concept of \"finding study partners\" isn't entirely new, your focus on *spontaneous, real-time, short-term, immediate help* is a significant differentiator. Many existing platforms facilitate scheduled study groups, but the \"I need 15 minutes right now\" aspect, especially with the potential for proximity-based matching, addresses a specific, often unmet need for instant academic micro-collaboration. It's a clever refinement of existing concepts, making it genuinely unique in its specific application.\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    Absolutely. You've perfectly captured the common student dilemma of needing quick, targeted help without the overhead of organizing a full study session. The inefficiency of current methods is a pain point many students experience. This app directly addresses that friction, making academic support more accessible and immediate.\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    Yes, highly feasible. You've clearly thought through the core technical components (UI/UX, authentication, real-time database, notifications, messaging) and correctly identified Firebase/Firestore as a suitable backend, which simplifies much of the server-side complexity for a student project. Your understanding of what constitutes a \"strong bonus\" (location services) versus core functionality demonstrates excellent scope awareness.\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    The scope is near-perfect. It's robust enough to demonstrate a wide range of smartphone programming skills (real-time data, user interaction, notifications, potentially location services) without becoming overwhelming for a single semester. Your clear distinction between core features and future enhancements shows strong project management foresight.\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    Without a doubt. You've articulated the user's pain points, the desired user flow (quick posts, filtering, direct chat), and the positive impact on academic collaboration and community support. The features are designed with the user's immediate needs and convenience in mind, aiming to reduce friction and foster genuine connections. Your personal reflection on connecting people further reinforces this user-centric approach.\n\n---\n\n**29/30**"}, "weekly_desc": "This week felt like a really good rhythm-setter, honestly.

It\u2019s been easy to stay on top of things when you\u2019re feeling this well-rested and positive.\n\nAcademically, it was a week of consistent attendance and absorbing information. I was in Kemeny for MATH 023, then over to Sudikoff for COSC 069, and LSB for COSC 065 \u2013 it\u2019s a good circuit. While I don't have any specific \"aha!\" moments or big breakthroughs to jot down from class this week, it felt more like a foundational period. We covered a lot of ground, and I was definitely engaged, taking notes and trying to connect the dots. Sometimes weeks are like that, less about a single memorable lecture and more about building a solid base. I'm really looking forward to seeing how these initial concepts build into more complex ideas. I feel like I'm steadily building up my understanding, even if it's not always in dramatic leaps.\n\nThe biggest thing on my mind, looking ahead, is the sheer number of deadlines piling up.
