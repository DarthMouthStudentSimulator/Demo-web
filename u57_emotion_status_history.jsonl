It\u2019s strange looking back because while I was definitely *around* campus, it feels like I didn't quite hit my stride academically.\n\nMy class schedule is pretty consistent, but the system says I had \"no class experience\" this week, and I can see why. I was in the Life Sciences Center on Wednesday and Friday, which aligns with COSC 060, but it didn't feel like I was fully engaged, or maybe I just wasn't in the right room at the right time for the system to pick it up. And Thursday and Monday were definitely a miss for both COSC 060 and COSC 065. I was in my dorm during those times, or even at Sudikoff for a bit on Thursday, which isn't where COSC 060 is. It's a bit concerning, especially with all these deadlines piling up. There are so many things due on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday next week, and I really need to get on top of them. My knowledge level feels pretty average right now, and I know I need to boost that.\n\nOutside of classes, I spent a lot of time in Parker House, just chilling or doing my own thing. It's comfortable, but maybe a little too comfortable sometimes. I did make it to the Boathouse quite a few times, which is always good. I enjoy being out on the water, and it's a great way to clear my head and keep my stamina up. I also hit the gym a couple of times, which felt good. It's nice to have those outlets to stay active. I even popped into Goldstein Hall and the Hopkins Center, and saw the Sphinx building, which was interesting. Just exploring a bit, I guess.\n\nSocially, things were pretty low-key. My extraversion isn't super high, so I'm fine with my own company, but I do appreciate connecting with people. I didn't really have any big social outings this week. My social meter is at 50, which feels about right. I'm not feeling isolated, but I also haven't gone out of my way to organize anything.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely getting back on track with my coursework. Missing classes isn't ideal, and now with all these deadlines looming, I can feel the pressure building. My sleep and stamina are both at 100, which is great, so I have the physical energy, it's just about channeling it effectively. My happiness is at 50, which is okay, but I think getting a handle on my academics would definitely boost that.\n\nFor next week, my main goals are clear:\n1.  **Attend every single class.** No excuses. I need to be present and engaged in COSC 060 and COSC 065.\n2.  **Tackle those deadlines head-on.** I'm going to map out all the assignments due on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday and make a plan to get them done. I need to be more conscientious about my work.\n3.  **Utilize campus resources.** Maybe spend more time studying in the library or Sudikoff, rather than just my dorm, to help me focus.\n4.  **Keep up with physical activity.** The Boathouse and gym sessions are good for me, and I want to maintain that balance.\n\nI'm feeling ready to turn things around and make next week a much more productive one.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: 100. The student explicitly states, \"My sleep and stamina are both at 100, which is great, so I have the physical energy.\" This is further supported by their engagement in physical activities like going to the Boathouse and hitting the gym, which they describe as good for \"keep my stamina up\" and \"stay active.\"\n- **Knowledge**: 50.

It's not ideal, and I feel a bit of a pang of responsibility about it, knowing how much work is coming.\n\nMy schedule was a bit all over the place. I spent a lot of time in Parker House, just kind of doing my own thing. There were a few late nights, like Wednesday when I was up until 1 AM, and then again on Saturday and Sunday, and even Monday and Tuesday early mornings. It's weird because despite the late hours, I still feel pretty well-rested and have good stamina, which is a plus, I guess. Maybe it's just my body adjusting to a different rhythm.\n\nI did manage to get out to a few academic buildings, even if it wasn't for class. I was at Sudikoff Hall late Wednesday, and then Vail and Fairchild on Friday. I think I was trying to get some work done on my own, which is good, but it's not the same as being in lecture. I also made it to the Sphinx Secret Society on Monday evening, which was a nice break and good to connect with people there. Other times, I was just... around, or in unknown spots, which is kind of how it goes sometimes.\n\nOverall, my happiness level feels pretty neutral, which is fine.

Ouch. I definitely didn't make it to my COSC 060 or 065 classes as much as I should have, or really, at all. I know I had them scheduled, and I even found myself in Sudikoff a couple of times, but I just didn't seem to settle into the actual lectures.

It's not ideal, and I know I need to address it.\n\nInstead of classes, I spent a fair bit of time at the Boathouse. It's been really good to get out on the water; it's a great way to burn off some energy and just clear my head. My stamina feels really high, which is a plus, and I think being active helps keep my overall mood pretty steady. I was also over at the Admissions Office quite a bit. It's always interesting there, and I like feeling involved, even if it means I'm not always in the classroom. I even managed to catch something at the Hopkins Center for the Arts on Monday, which was a nice break.\n\nSocially, things felt pretty good.

I didn't make it to my COSC 060 or COSC 065 lectures this week. It wasn't ideal, and I usually try to be really on top of attendance, but with so many deadlines looming, I made the call to prioritize getting some major project work done. There are so many assignments due on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and I felt like I needed to dedicate solid, uninterrupted blocks of time to them. My general knowledge feels okay, but there's definitely a specific area where I feel like I'm really lagging, and I needed to put in the hours to try and bridge that gap.\n\nThat's why I spent a lot of time in Sudikoff Hall, especially late at night. I was there on Wednesday, Sunday, and Monday, just grinding away. It's a good space to focus. I even found myself in Fairchild Physical Sciences Center super late on Monday and Tuesday nights, which was a change of scenery but still all about getting work done. It's a bit of a weird schedule, being up so late, but I seem to be catching up on sleep fine, so it works for now.\n\nOutside of the academic grind, I did manage to get out a little. I popped over to the Hood Museum on Wednesday evening, which was a nice break from screens and code. Just wandering around and looking at art was surprisingly refreshing. I also grabbed food at the Commons, and spent some time by the Boathouse. It's a peaceful spot, good for just clearing my head, even if I wasn't actively doing anything there. I also had a couple of quick stops at the Admissions Office and McNutt Hall \u2013 nothing major, just some quick errands.\n\nThe biggest challenge was definitely the balancing act.

But I felt like I had to make that choice this week to ensure I could submit quality work for these deadlines.\n\nLooking ahead to next week, my main goal is to get back on track with my classes. I need to catch up on the lectures I missed, probably by watching recordings, and make sure I understand everything before the next set of topics. I also want to try and get a head start on any new assignments so I don't end up in the same crunch again.

Those early morning and late-night sessions out on the water, or just being there, really help clear my head and keep me feeling energized. It\u2019s a good balance to all the screen time.

I noticed I didn't make it to any of my scheduled COSC 060 or 065 classes this week. That's definitely something I need to address. My intention wasn't to skip, but with so many deadlines piling up \u2013 seriously, a whole bunch due Monday, then Tuesday, and more on Wednesday \u2013 I found myself really hunkering down on project work and self-study. I spent a lot of time in Sudikoff Hall and Steele Hall, especially late into the evenings, just grinding through code and concepts. It felt like the most efficient use of my time to get a handle on the assignments that are due, rather than sitting through lectures where I might not be actively coding. I know the material for these classes is important, and I feel like I have a decent grasp overall (my general knowledge is good), but there are definitely some specific areas where I feel like I'm only at about 45% understanding, and those are the ones I was trying to shore up. I'll need to catch up on the lecture content I missed, maybe by reviewing notes from classmates or watching recordings if they're available.\n\nOutside of academics, I was pretty active. The Boathouse seems to be my second home sometimes \u2013 I was there quite a bit, even late at night or early in the morning. It\u2019s a great way to clear my head and get some exercise. I also hit the Alumni Gym. Keeping up with physical activity really helps me stay focused and energized, which is crucial when I'm spending so much time on coursework.\n\nSocially, I know I'm not exactly a social butterfly, and this week was no exception. My social meter is pretty low, and looking back at my activities, most of my \"active\" time was spent either working alone in the CS buildings, at the gym, or at the Boathouse. I did have a moment at the Hopkins Center for the Arts on Saturday, which was a nice change of pace, but generally, I kept to myself. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t enjoy being around people, but when I get into a work groove, I tend to just stay there.\n\nMy main challenge this week was definitely balancing the immediate need to work on assignments with attending classes. It felt like a trade-off, and I chose to prioritize getting the work done. The sheer number of upcoming deadlines is a bit daunting, and I felt the pressure to make progress.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize Class Attendance:** I absolutely need to get back into the rhythm of attending COSC 060 and 065 lectures. I can't keep missing them, even if I feel like I'm catching up on my own. It's important for staying on track and engaging with the professors and material in real-time.\n2.  **Deadline Management:** With so many assignments due early next week, I need to make sure I'm not just *working* on them, but *completing* them to a high standard. I'll try to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks.\n3.  **Boost Social Interaction (Even a Little):** Maybe I can grab a meal with someone from my dorm, or join a study group for one of my COSC classes.

I'm still feeling really happy and well-rested, which is always a plus. My stamina is through the roof, probably thanks to all the time I've been spending at the Boathouse. It's become such a consistent part of my routine, and I really enjoy being out there. It's a great way to clear my head and just move.\n\nAcademically, it was a bit of a mixed bag. I noticed I didn't make it to any of my COSC 060 or 065 classes this week. I know I *should* be there, but honestly, with so many deadlines looming for next week \u2013 especially all those Monday ones \u2013 I felt like my time was better spent getting a head start on the assignments. I spent a lot of late nights and early mornings in Sudikoff Hall, just grinding through problem sets. It's a bit of a trade-off, I guess. I'm conscientious about getting the work done, and sometimes that means prioritizing the actual coding over the lectures, especially when I feel like I can catch up on the material later. It's not ideal, but I'm not feeling too stressed about it, which is good. My knowledge levels are decent, so I must be picking things up somehow.\n\nMy social life was pretty quiet again this week, which isn't really a surprise. My social score is still super low, but honestly, I'm okay with that. I'm not really one for big crowds or constant socializing. I get a lot of energy from just focusing on my own things, whether that's rowing or diving deep into a coding problem. I did pop into the Alumni Gym for a bit, and even made it out to Glen Road Plaza for something, but mostly it was just me, my dorm, the Boathouse, and Sudikoff.\n\nThe biggest challenge looking ahead is definitely that mountain of deadlines for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It's a lot to juggle, and I need to make sure I'm efficient.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Tackle those deadlines:** I need to stay on top of all the COSC assignments. I've put in some good groundwork, so now it's about finishing strong.\n2.  **Re-evaluate class attendance:** Maybe I should try to make it to at least one or two of my COSC classes, even if it's just to get a feel for what I'm missing. Or at least dedicate specific time to reviewing the lecture material.\n3.  **Keep up the Boathouse routine:** It's great for my physical and mental well-being, and I don't want to drop that.\n4.  **Maybe a tiny social step:** Nothing major, but perhaps just a quick chat with someone in Sudikoff or at the Boathouse. Just a small step to keep things balanced.\n\nOverall, I'm feeling positive. I'm managing my time in a way that works for me right now, even if it's a bit unconventional with the class skipping.

It's funny, despite the constant grind, I feel pretty good \u2013 my happiness, sleep, and stamina are all surprisingly high. I guess that consistent time at the boathouse really helps keep me grounded and energized. Those early morning and late-night sessions out on the water are definitely my escape.\n\nAcademically, it was a heavy week, especially with all those deadlines piling up for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I spent *a lot* of time in Sudikoff Hall, practically living there some nights. I was definitely pulling some late ones, like that all-nighter into Wednesday morning, just trying to get everything done. It feels good to dive deep into the material when I'm working on projects, and I think my knowledge is building up, even if it's not always from the traditional classroom setting.\n\nSpeaking of which, I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. I know, I know. It's not ideal. With so many project deadlines looming, I found myself prioritizing the hands-on work and self-study in Sudikoff over attending lectures. It felt like I had to make a choice, and getting those assignments done was the immediate priority. I was mostly in my dorm during class times, trying to focus or just catch a breath before heading back to the CS building. It's a bit of a balancing act, and sometimes I feel like I'm just trying to keep my head above water with the workload.\n\nMy social life, well, that's still pretty much non-existent. My social score is super low, and looking back at the week, I can see why. I was either in my dorm, at the boathouse, or holed up in Sudikoff. I didn't really connect with anyone outside of those spaces, and even then, it was mostly just passing by. I'm not the most outgoing person anyway, so it doesn't feel like a huge void, but sometimes I do wonder if I should try to branch out a little more. That random trip to the West Lebanon Post Office was probably the most \"out there\" thing I did all week, which is kind of sad when I think about it.\n\nThe biggest challenge was definitely managing the sheer volume of work and those back-to-back deadlines. It felt like a constant race against the clock, and I ended up sacrificing class time to get the projects done.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to get back into a better rhythm with classes. I really need to make an effort to attend COSC 060 and 065. I also want to try and get a head start on assignments so I'm not pulling so many all-nighters right before deadlines. It would be nice to maintain my boathouse routine, as that's clearly helping me stay sane and energized.

You've clearly identified a genuine pain point for university students and proposed a practical, relevant solution.\n\nHere's my evaluation based on the criteria:\n\n*   **Is the idea innovative or unique compared to existing apps?**\n    While campus maps exist, the focus on dynamic availability (even if simulated for the project) and granular amenity-based filtering for study spaces is a significant step beyond static information. It addresses a specific, nuanced need that isn't typically met by general campus navigation tools. The \"right environment\" focus is a good differentiator.\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    Absolutely. The frustration of finding suitable study spots, especially with specific requirements (quiet, group, software), is a universal student experience. You've articulated this problem very well, demonstrating empathy for the user.\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    Excellent consideration of feasibility. Your plan to simulate availability is a smart way to tackle a complex real-world feature within the constraints of a semester project, allowing you to demonstrate the *concept* without getting bogged down in real-time sensor integration. The listed programming concepts are appropriate and achievable.\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    This is a perfect scope. It's far more complex and useful than a basic app, requiring multiple core mobile development skills (UI/UX, data persistence, navigation, filtering, potentially API integration, notifications). Yet, by carefully defining the \"simulated\" aspects and focusing on core functionality, you've avoided over-ambition. The Pomodoro timer and favorites add value without bloat.\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    Yes, very much so. Your emphasis on \"optimizing a student's time and reducing stress,\" \"clean, intuitive interface,\" and the detailed filtering options all point to a strong user-centric design approach. You're not just building an app; you're solving a problem for a specific user group.\n\nThis project demonstrates a strong understanding of both the problem domain and the technical requirements of mobile application development. You've clearly put significant thought into balancing innovation with feasibility.\n\n**29/30**"}, "weekly_desc": "", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina**: The absence of any journal entry suggests a potential lack of energy or motivation to complete the self-reflection task. While not explicitly stated, the effort required to write a journal was not expended, indicating a possible slight dip in overall stamina or willingness to engage.\n-   **Knowledge**: No new insights, reflections on learning, or academic progress were documented. This implies a period without significant intellectual breakthroughs or a lack of engagement in reflecting on knowledge acquisition.\n-   **Stress**: A blank journal can sometimes be a sign of being overwhelmed, too busy, or too stressed to engage in reflective tasks. This suggests that stress levels might be maintained or slightly elevated, as the student did not allocate time or mental energy for reflection.\n-   **Happy**: The lack of any reflection, even on positive experiences, could hint at a slight decrease in overall contentment or a reduced motivation to express happiness or positive feelings.\n-   **Sleep**: With no information provided in the journal, it is difficult to infer any changes in sleep patterns. Therefore, the previous state is assumed to persist due to the absence of new data.\n-   **Social**: The journal provides no new information regarding social interactions. This suggests that the previously low social engagement remains unchanged, as there is no indication of new connections or activities."}
