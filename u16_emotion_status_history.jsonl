I really need to get a grip on my class attendance. COSC 065 and COSC 027... it's just been a mess.\n\nI don't know what it is, but I just can't seem to pull myself away from the boathouse. It's like a magnet. I know I *should* be in LSB for 065, or Sudikoff for 027, but then I find myself just... there. Sometimes I'm actually out on the water, especially those early mornings around 5 AM, which feels amazing and clears my head, but then I look at the time and realize I've completely blown off a lecture. My conscientiousness is screaming at me, telling me I'm letting myself down, and that just makes the knot in my stomach tighter.\n\nThursday was a prime example. I was supposed to be in COSC 065 at noon, but I was still at the boathouse. Then I rushed over to LSB later, but by the time I got to Sudikoff for COSC 027, I'd already missed a chunk of it. It's so frustrating because I *want* to be on top of things. And Friday, same thing with COSC 065 at 10 AM \u2013 I was at the Commons, not in class. And Monday... don't even get me started on Monday. Both COSC classes, completely missed. I was at the boathouse again, or just wandering around. It's like I get stuck in this loop, and the thought of facing the professors or falling further behind just paralyzes me.\n\nI spend so much time at the boathouse, it's almost embarrassing. It's my escape, I guess. When I'm out on the water, everything else just fades away. It's where I feel most at peace, most myself. But then I come back, and the reality of all these looming deadlines just crashes down on me. There are so many. Every time I check my calendar, it's another one due Thursday, Tuesday, Monday, again and again. It just adds to the pressure. I feel this constant hum of worry.\n\nI've been trying to make up for it by staying up late in Sudikoff, just trying to piece together what I missed. I was there late Wednesday, Sunday, and Tuesday night, trying to catch up on the material. It feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and it's exhausting. My brain just feels fried, even though I know I'm getting enough sleep hours overall. The timing is just all over the place.\n\nSocially, it was pretty quiet. I mean, I was at the Commons a few times for meals, and I walked past Chi Heorot on Monday, but I didn't really connect with anyone. I guess I haven't really been seeking it out. When I'm this stressed about classes and feeling so behind, it's hard to think about anything else. I just retreat into my own head, which probably isn't the healthiest thing.\n\nMy biggest challenge right now is definitely getting myself to class consistently. It's not that I don't care, it's just... a struggle. And then the guilt piles up, which makes it even harder to focus. I feel like I'm letting myself down, and that's a terrible feeling.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to prioritize class attendance. No more excuses. I need to set multiple alarms, leave the boathouse earlier, whatever it takes to be in LSB and Sudikoff when I'm supposed to be. I also need to dedicate specific, uninterrupted blocks of time to catching up on the material I've missed, especially for COSC 027 and 065. Maybe I can even try to find a study buddy, even though that's a bit out of my comfort zone, but it might help with accountability. And I need to try and manage my stress better, maybe not let the boathouse consume *all* my time, even if it feels good in the moment.

I didn't make it to any of my COSC 065 lectures this week, not Thursday, Friday, or Monday. And COSC 027 wasn't much better; I missed both sessions on Thursday and Monday. It\u2019s frustrating because I know I *should* be there, and I feel this constant knot of anxiety about falling behind. My conscientiousness is screaming at me, but my body just feels so drained. I spent a lot of time at Sudikoff late at night, trying to make up for it, just grinding through problem sets and readings. It feels like I\u2019m constantly playing catch-up, and it\u2019s exhausting. I know the material, I really do, but the actual act of getting to class feels impossible sometimes.\n\nMost of my week was spent at the boathouse. I don't know what it is about that place, but I just gravitate there. It\u2019s where I feel most... something. I was there for hours on end, especially Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. There were a few times I was actually *doing* something there, which was good, I guess, but mostly it felt like I was just existing. I did manage to hit the gym a couple of times, which was a small win, but even that felt like a monumental effort.\n\nMy social life is pretty much non-existent right now. I barely saw anyone outside of the dining hall, and even then, it was mostly just grabbing food and heading back to whatever I was doing. I know I should probably try to connect with people more, but honestly, I just don't have the energy. My happiness levels are so low, and I just feel perpetually tired and overwhelmed. It\u2019s hard to be social when you feel like you\u2019re constantly on the verge of collapsing.\n\nThe biggest challenge, besides the sheer exhaustion, is the mountain of deadlines looming. There are so many due dates next week \u2013 multiple on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, plus one on Wednesday.

Even if I\u2019m tired, I need to physically be there. I also need to figure out a better way to manage these deadlines. Maybe I can break them down into smaller, more manageable chunks instead of letting them pile up. And I really, really need to prioritize sleep.

I know I have COSC 065 and COSC 027, and I *intended* to be in those lectures. But looking back, I didn't actually make it to any of them. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s just\u2026 I get so caught up in the actual *doing* of the work. Like, I spent so much time in Sudikoff, especially late Wednesday and Thursday nights. I was really trying to dig into some of the concepts for COSC 027, and it felt like I was making progress, but then there are moments where I feel like I only grasp about 15% of what I *should* know, even though I generally feel pretty confident in my knowledge. It\u2019s this constant push and pull, feeling like I\u2019m on top of things one minute and completely lost the next. The deadlines are just piling up too \u2013 so many due on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. It\u2019s a lot to juggle, and the thought of missing something important just makes my stomach clench.\n\nI guess that\u2019s why I ended up just focusing on the problem sets and projects.

But then the guilt sets in, knowing I *should* have been there. It\u2019s a cycle.\n\nDespite the academic stress, I actually feel pretty good physically. My sleep has been solid, which is a huge relief, and my stamina feels high. So at least I have the energy to *do* the work, even if it\u2019s at odd hours. Socially, things are pretty quiet, which is fine for me. I had a few meals at the Commons, and I was at the Boathouse a lot, which is usually just a quiet space for me to decompress or think. I did have that brief moment at the dorm on Thursday and then the parking lot on Tuesday, which were just quick things, nothing major.

It's like a constant low hum of anxiety.\n\nAcademically, this week was a disaster. I don't know what happened, but I just couldn't bring myself to go to class. Every single one. COSC 065 on Friday, Monday, and Thursday? Missed them all. COSC 027 on Monday and Thursday? Skipped those too. I was *in* Sudikoff on Thursday afternoon, but I just couldn't make it into the lecture hall. It's like there's this invisible wall. I know I need to be there, I know the material is important, and I know I'm falling behind. The knowledge score says I know a lot, but it feels like it's all slipping away, especially with this week's content. It's a terrifying feeling, like I'm smart enough but just can't *do* it.\n\nAnd the deadlines. Oh god, the deadlines. There are so many of them, just piling up. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, a Wednesday thrown in there. It's overwhelming, and missing class just makes that knot in my stomach tighter. I keep thinking about all the work I *should* be doing, and then I just\u2026 don't.\n\nMost of my time was spent at the dining hall, just existing, or back at the Boathouse, which feels like my default hideout. I did manage to get to the gym a couple of times, which felt good for a moment, like I was doing *something* productive, but it didn't really lift the cloud. I also ended up at the Admissions Office and the Post Office, just running errands, I guess. And I was in Sudikoff late on Wednesday and Sunday, trying to convince myself to work, but it was mostly just\u2026 being there.\n\nSocially, it was a quiet week, which isn't unusual for me. I'm not really one for big groups, and honestly, with how I'm feeling, I don't have the energy to pretend to be okay. My social score is practically non-existent, but I guess that's just how I operate when things get tough. I retreat.\n\nThe biggest challenge was definitely the inertia. The feeling of being stuck, knowing what I need to do, but being completely unable to start. It's a vicious cycle: I miss class, I feel guilty and anxious, which makes me want to avoid everything even more, and then I miss more class. My neuroticism is definitely having a field day with this.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to break this cycle. My main goal is to attend every single class. No excuses. I need to get back into the routine, even if it feels impossible right now. I also need to tackle at least one of those looming deadlines head-on, just to get some momentum. Maybe the one due on Wednesday, since it's the closest. And I need to try and be a bit kinder to myself, even when I'm feeling like a complete failure.

Not COSC 065, not COSC 027. I saw them on my schedule, I knew where they were supposed to be, but I just... couldn't. It's frustrating because I *want* to be there, I want to learn, and I know I *should* be attending. My conscientiousness is screaming at me, but the anxiety just paralyzes me.\n\nInstead, it felt like I was just bouncing between Sudikoff and the Commons. I spent so much time in Sudikoff, especially late at night. Like Wednesday night, I was there until midnight, and then again on Thursday and Friday, just trying to get things done. There are so many deadlines looming \u2013 Mon, Tue, Thu, Wed, they're all stacked up. It feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and it's exhausting.

I'm trying to get enough sleep, but the work just piles up, and the only time I feel like I can focus is when everyone else is asleep.\n\nSocially, it was pretty much a desert. My extraversion is low anyway, so I don't naturally seek out big groups, but this week I barely saw anyone outside of the dining hall. Even then, it was mostly just me, grabbing food at odd hours. I went to the gym once, and then that late-night trip to Jewel of India on Tuesday, but that was about it. It makes me feel even more isolated, which just feeds into the whole anxious cycle.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely the overwhelming feeling of being behind, even when I'm trying so hard to catch up.

I know I have the knowledge, but applying it under this pressure feels impossible.\n\nFor next week, my absolute top priority is to get to class. I *have* to. I need to break this cycle of missing lectures and then trying to teach myself everything from the notes. I'm going to try to set a stricter schedule for myself, especially for sleep, even if it means sacrificing a bit of late-night work.

It\u2019s hard to even piece together what happened, or what *didn't* happen. My head feels foggy, and my body just aches with exhaustion. I know I should be feeling something more, but mostly it's just this dull, heavy dread.\n\nThe biggest thing, the one that\u2019s really gnawing at me, is class. I missed *everything*. Every single COSC 065 lecture, every COSC 027 session. I saw them on my schedule, I knew where I was supposed to be, but I just\u2026 couldn't. It\u2019s like there was an invisible wall. On Wednesday, I was at the Commons when I should have been in Sudikoff for 027. Thursday, same thing, Commons instead of LSB for 065, and then I was in Sudikoff later, but not actually *doing* anything for 027. Friday, Monday, Tuesday \u2013 the pattern just repeated. I was mostly at the Commons, just existing, while my classes were happening elsewhere. It makes me feel so incredibly guilty and anxious. I pride myself on being on top of things, but this week, it felt impossible. My knowledge levels for both classes are still decent, which is a small comfort, but it doesn't make up for the missed material or the feeling of falling behind.\n\nI spent an insane amount of time at the Class of 1953 Commons. It\u2019s weird, because I wasn't really *doing* anything there for most of those hours. Just\u2026 being. Sometimes I'd try to open my laptop, but my brain just wouldn't engage. It felt like a safe, neutral space, I guess, when I didn't have the energy to be anywhere else, or even to go back to my dorm. I only really logged being at Parker House for a couple of hours early Friday morning. Where was I even sleeping the rest of the time? I don't even know. My sleep is so messed up, it's no wonder I feel like a zombie.\n\nThere were a few times I made it to Sudikoff, the CS building. On Thursday, I was there for hours in the afternoon and evening. And again on Sunday evening, and Tuesday afternoon. I *wanted* to work, I really did. I know there are so many deadlines coming up \u2013 a bunch on Thursday, then Tuesday, Monday, Wednesday\u2026 it\u2019s a constant stream. The thought of them just paralyzes me. I'd sit there, staring at the screen, feeling the pressure build, but nothing would click. It\u2019s frustrating because I know I *can* do the work, but the energy just isn't there. My stamina is practically non-existent.\n\nThe only other place I seemed to gravitate towards was the Boathouse. I was there late Wednesday night, then again late Thursday, and even really early Sunday morning. I don't know what I was doing there, but it felt like a place to just breathe, away from everything. Maybe it was a way to get some physical activity in, even if it was just walking around, trying to clear my head. It\u2019s definitely not a social thing; my social battery is completely drained. I barely interacted with anyone this week, which isn't great, but I just don't have the capacity for it right now.\n\nMy happiness is at zero, and it feels accurate. This week has been a struggle. The constant anxiety about what I'm not doing, the exhaustion, the feeling of being stuck in a loop of inaction \u2013 it\u2019s all just overwhelming.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to turn this around. My main goal is just to *show up*. I need to get to COSC 065 on Monday and Friday, and COSC 027 on Monday and Thursday. Even if I just sit there and absorb a fraction of it, it's better than nothing. I also need to prioritize sleep. Seriously. I can't function like this. I need to find a way to break this cycle of just existing at the Commons and actually get some rest in my dorm.

Your personal connection to the problem shines through, which often leads to the most impactful solutions.\n\nHere's the evaluation:\n\n*   **Is the idea innovative or unique compared to existing apps?**\n    While task managers are ubiquitous, AcademiaFlow carves out a strong niche. The explicit focus on \"micro-tasking\" to combat \"analysis paralysis\" for academic projects, combined with course-centric organization and integrated resource linking, provides a unique value proposition. It's not a revolutionary concept, but it's a highly refined and targeted application of existing ideas, making it innovative in its specific domain.\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    Absolutely. The \"analysis paralysis\" and feeling overwhelmed by academic deadlines are universal experiences for university students. You've articulated this problem perfectly, demonstrating a deep understanding of the user's pain points. This is a highly relatable and pressing need.\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    Yes, highly feasible. You've done an excellent job breaking down the features and mapping them to standard mobile development concepts (data persistence, UI lists, notifications, timers, URL handling). You've also wisely identified potential complexities (like \"Do Not Disturb\" mode) and offered feasible alternatives, showing a realistic grasp of the scope. This project provides ample opportunity to demonstrate core programming skills without requiring overly complex or experimental technologies.\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    The scope is near-perfect. It's far more than a trivial \"hello world\" app, offering multiple layers of functionality and data management. Yet, it avoids the pitfalls of over-ambition (e.g., real-time collaboration, complex AI, or external API dependencies beyond simple URL opening). This project provides a robust learning experience and a tangible, useful product within a semester's timeframe.\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    Without a doubt. Your personal narrative immediately establishes a strong user empathy. Every feature, from micro-tasking to resource linking and the 'Focus Flow' timer, is designed to directly alleviate the stress and disorganization common among students. The potential impact on a student's productivity and mental well-being is clear and compelling. This isn't just a technical exercise; it's a solution born from genuine user need.\n\n**Overall Score:** 29/30\n\nThis is an outstanding project idea. You've clearly put significant thought into both the problem space and the technical implementation. The detailed breakdown of features and corresponding programming concepts is exactly what we look for. Well done."}, "weekly_desc": "This week felt like a blur, honestly.

My happiness levels are pretty much at rock bottom, and my brain feels like it's constantly buzzing with a low hum of anxiety. It's exhausting.\n\nAcademically, it's a mess. The class experience summary says \"no class experience recorded,\" and that's pretty accurate for how I *feel* about it. I know I have COSC 065 and COSC 027, and I definitely missed my Monday classes. I just couldn't bring myself to go. I was so deep in the weeds with something, probably for COSC 027 \u2013 that's the one I'm really struggling with, the one where my knowledge feels stuck at 65. COSC 065, I feel pretty good about, but 027 is just a constant source of dread.\n\nAnd then Wednesday... I was in Sudikoff from 4 AM. *Four AM*. I don't even know what \"Activity: No\" means for that block of time. Was I just staring at my screen? Was I trying to work but my brain just wouldn't cooperate?

I'm not really seeking out much interaction, which isn't unusual for me, but it also means there's not much to pull me out of this academic spiral. Sleep is average, stamina is average, but it doesn't *feel* average. It feels like I'm running on fumes, constantly on edge. My brain just won't switch off, always replaying what I *should* be doing, what I've missed, how far behind I am.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely this overwhelming sense of being behind and the sheer volume of work.
