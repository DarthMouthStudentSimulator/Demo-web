That definitely helps keep my spirits up, even when things get a bit hectic.\n\nHowever, looking back, I've got to be real with myself about my class attendance. It's pretty clear from the data that I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week \u2013 not MUS 003, COSC 050, or COSC 065. That's definitely not ideal, and it's something I need to address head-on. Usually, I'm super diligent about showing up, so seeing \"No class experience recorded this week\" really makes me pause. I was in my dorm a lot during class times, which means I wasn't even close to Kemeny, LSB, or Hopkins when I should have been. I'm not entirely sure what happened there, whether I got caught up in other things or just lost track of time, but it's a significant lapse for me.\n\nDespite the class misses, I did manage to get some things done and stay engaged in other ways. I spent some time in Sudikoff Hall on Wednesday evening and again late Tuesday night, which was good for focusing on some COSC-related work. It's always a productive environment there. I also found myself at the Hopkins Center for the Arts a couple of times, once really late on Sunday night/Monday morning and again on Tuesday evening. Given my MUS 003 class, it's probably my creative side pulling me there, exploring different artistic avenues. It's a great space to just be present and soak in the atmosphere. I also popped by the Admissions Office on Monday afternoon \u2013 not sure what that was about, maybe just an errand or helping someone out.\n\nSocially, it was a pretty active week, which I always appreciate. I spent some time at Alpha Phi and the Sphinx Secret Society, which are always fun places to connect with people. Even if the data just says \"No activity,\" it means I was there, hanging out, and enjoying the company. For me, those social interactions are really important for recharging and feeling connected to the campus community. My social meter is at a neutral 50, which feels about right \u2013 I was out and about, but maybe not deeply engaged in a way that would push it higher.\n\nThe biggest challenge moving forward is definitely catching up on what I missed in classes and getting ahead of the upcoming deadlines. Looking at my schedule, there's a whole mountain of assignments due in the next few days and weeks \u2013 a bunch on Friday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. It's a lot to juggle, and missing class certainly doesn't make it easier. I also had a big chunk of \"Unknown\" time on Sunday, which is a bit of a blank spot in my memory, but I'm glad I was able to get some activity in there too.\n\nFor next week, my primary goal is to get back on track with my academics. I need to make class attendance a non-negotiable priority. I'll set extra alarms and make sure I'm physically in those classrooms. Beyond that, I'm going to break down all those deadlines into manageable chunks and start tackling them systematically. I want to make sure I'm not just doing the work, but truly understanding the material, especially in COSC. I also want to continue balancing my academic focus with my social life and creative outlets. It's all about finding that sweet spot where I'm productive, engaged, and still enjoying the university experience.

It's nice to wake up feeling ready to tackle the day, even if the day didn't always go as planned.\n\nBut then I look at my class schedule and my actual attendance, and it's a bit of a wake-up call. \"No class experience recorded\" \u2013 wow, that hits hard. I literally missed *every single one* of my classes this week. MUS 003, COSC 050, COSC 065... all of them. That's definitely not ideal, especially with all these deadlines piling up. I'm usually so on top of my academics, so this feels really out of character for me. My conscientiousness is usually one of my strongest traits, so I'm a bit baffled by how I let this happen.\n\nI need to figure out what happened. Looking back, I spent a lot of time in my dorm, which is fine for studying, but not when I should be in class. And then there were those times I was at the Boathouse, or the Admissions Office, or even the Hopkins Center when I should have been in a lecture. I guess I just got really caught up in other things, or maybe I just wasn't prioritizing my schedule as well as I usually do. I was at the Admissions Office a couple of times, which was interesting, and spent a good amount of time at the Boathouse \u2013 maybe I was just enjoying the fresh air a bit too much. I also found myself at the Hopkins Center a few times, which is always inspiring, but again, not for my actual MUS class.\n\nMy social life felt pretty good though! Had some fun nights at Alpha Phi, and generally felt connected. My social battery is at 50%, which is decent, and I love being out and about with people. But maybe those late nights contributed to me sleeping through alarms or just feeling less motivated to get out of bed for morning classes. It's a balance, right? I'm pretty extraverted, so connecting with friends is important to me, but it can't come at the expense of my studies.\n\nThe biggest challenge, hands down, is the knowledge gap from missing classes. My general knowledge is okay, but that 35% for specific knowledge is probably a direct result of not being in lectures. It's a bit frustrating because I know I'm capable, and I'm usually so on top of things. I'm not feeling particularly stressed about it, which is good, but I know I need to address it head-on.\n\nLooking ahead, I absolutely need to get back on track. My goals for next week are clear:\n1.  **Attend every single class.** No excuses. I need to set multiple alarms and make sure I'm out the door, especially for those morning COSC classes.\n2.  **Catch up on missed material.** I'll dedicate specific blocks of time to review the lectures and readings I missed for MUS 003, COSC 050, and COSC 065. I'll probably hit up the Fairchild Physical Sciences Center to really focus on the COSC material.\n3.  **Prioritize academics during class hours.** If I'm not in class, I need to be actively studying or working on assignments, especially with all those deadlines coming up. There are so many due dates this week and next, I can't afford to fall further behind.\n4.  **Balance social life.** I love being social, but I need to make sure it doesn't interfere with my academic commitments. Maybe shift some social activities to later in the day or weekend, or make sure I'm getting to bed at a reasonable hour on weeknights.\n\nI'm feeling positive about turning this around. I've got the energy and the drive, I just need to channel it more effectively towards my studies.

I've noticed I haven't been making it to all my scheduled classes, which is definitely something I need to address. Like, I completely missed MUS 003 on Thursday and Tuesday, and even the Wednesday one. And my COSC classes, 050 and 065, I didn't make it to those either. I saw the \"no class experience recorded\" and yeah, that tracks. It's not ideal, especially with how conscientious I try to be. My knowledge score is still pretty low, and I can feel it. There are so many deadlines coming up \u2013 like, a bunch of Fridays and Tuesdays, plus Mondays and Sundays \u2013 so I really need to get on top of things. I did manage to get some work done at Baker-Berry Library on Monday, and a late-night session at Sudikoff on Tuesday, which felt productive, but it's not the same as being in class.\n\nThe main reason for the class misses, I think, has been my commitment to the boathouse. I've been spending a *lot* of time there \u2013 early mornings on Saturday, late nights on Wednesday and Thursday, even a quick pop-in on Tuesday afternoon. It's incredibly demanding, but I absolutely love it. The team is fantastic, and the physical activity keeps my stamina through the roof. It's such a great outlet, and I feel so energized after being out on the water. I also had to swing by the Admissions Office a couple of times, which took up some time.\n\nSocially, I feel pretty good. My social score is sitting at 50, which is okay, but with how much I love being around people, I think I could definitely do more. Most of my social interaction this week has been with the boathouse crew, which is awesome, but I'd like to branch out a bit more. I was at the Hopkins Center a few times, caught some activity there, and even visited Topliff Hall late one night. It's good to connect with different people.\n\nThe biggest challenge right now is definitely balancing everything. I'm happy and well-rested, which is great, but I can't let my academics slide, especially with all these deadlines looming.\n\nFor next week, my main goals are:\n1.  **Prioritize class attendance:** I need to make a conscious effort to be in those lectures. I'm going to set extra alarms and plan my mornings better around boathouse activities.\n2.  **Catch up on missed material:** I'll dedicate specific blocks of time in the library or Sudikoff to review everything I've missed in MUS 003, COSC 050, and COSC 065.\n3.  **Start tackling deadlines early:** With so many due, I need to break them down and start chipping away at them well before the last minute.\n4.  **Diversify social interactions:** While I love the boathouse, I want to make an effort to connect with more people outside of that group. Maybe grab coffee with someone from one of my classes, or join a study group.\n\nI'm feeling optimistic about getting back on track.

It's a bit jarring to realize that, especially since I genuinely value my education and consider myself a very conscientious person. I think I got a little swept up in all the other activities and commitments, particularly with the Boathouse, and just didn't prioritize getting to class. I did try to compensate by spending some late nights in Fairchild and Sudikoff, trying to catch up on the material, but it's not the same as being there in person.

I'm going to make a concerted effort to attend all my classes \u2013 MUS 003, COSC 050, and COSC 065 \u2013 and really engage with the material. I need to dedicate some solid blocks of time to catching up on what I missed and getting a head start on those assignments. I'll probably hit up Fairchild or Sudikoff to really dive into the COSC work. I'm confident I can get back on track. I'm still planning on being at the Boathouse, of course, because that's a huge part of my routine and keeps me feeling great, but I'll be more strategic about balancing it all. It's all about finding that sweet spot where I can excel in everything I do!", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: The student explicitly states \"My happy, sleep, social, and stamina stats are all through the roof\" and describes feeling \"so energized\" and having \"amazing energy.\"\n- **Knowledge**: The student admits to having \"didn't make it to any of my scheduled lectures\" and states \"My knowledge stat is definitely feeling it, though \u2013 it's a bit of a wake-up call,\" indicating a significant deficit.\n- **Stress**: The student explicitly states \"I'm not stressed about it,\" but acknowledges \"upcoming deadlines piling up\" and that \"It's a lot to catch up on,\" suggesting a low level of concern rather than high stress.\n- **Happy**: The student states \"My happy, sleep, social, and stamina stats are all through the roof\" and uses phrases like \"pure adrenaline and good vibes,\" \"wouldn't have it any other way,\" and \"feeling so energized and connected, it's been fantastic.\"\n- **Sleep**: The student states \"My happy, sleep, social, and stamina stats are all through the roof\" and clarifies that despite \"sacrificing a bit of sleep sometimes,\" they are \"still getting plenty!\"\n- **Social**: The student states \"My happy, sleep, social, and stamina stats are all through the roof\" and describes feeling \"connected,\" enjoying \"team energy,\" and having \"fun to swing by Alpha Phi and Parker House to hang out with friends.\""}

I'm feeling incredibly energized and happy, which is a fantastic way to head into the next one. My sleep has been great, and I've had so much stamina to really dive into everything campus life has to offer.\n\nCampus life has been buzzing, and I've been right in the thick of it. I spent a lot of time at the Hop, which is always so vibrant, whether it's for a creative burst or just soaking in the atmosphere. The Boathouse has also become a bit of a second home; there's just something about being by the water that's so refreshing. I've loved being able to connect with people, whether it's a quick chat in Zahm Courtyard or grabbing a bite at the Commons. My social battery is definitely full, and I thrive on all these interactions.\n\nNow, on the academic front, it's been... interesting. I noticed the system didn't log much \"class experience\" for me this week, and honestly, that's pretty accurate for my physical attendance. I've been so immersed in other activities and projects that my class attendance wasn't as consistent as I'd like it to be. It's a bit of a paradox, because I'm usually so on top of things, and I genuinely *want* to learn. My knowledge score definitely reflects that I haven't been absorbing as much as I should be from lectures. I think part of it is just getting into the rhythm of things, and there were a few times I was just so deep into something else \u2013 like that late-night creative burst at the Hop, or getting some serious work done at the Boathouse \u2013 that the class schedule just slipped. Or maybe I was just catching up on sleep after a particularly engaging social event.\n\nIt's not ideal, especially with all these deadlines piling up. I've got a lot of assignments coming due, which means I really need to buckle down and make sure I'm not just *planning* to learn, but actually *doing* it.\n\nThe main challenge is definitely balancing everything. I love being involved and exploring, but I also know that my primary purpose here is to learn. My knowledge score is a clear indicator that I need to shift some focus back to the core academics. It's not a stressor, thankfully \u2013 I feel really good overall \u2013 but it's a clear area for improvement.\n\nFor next week, my absolute top priority is class attendance. I need to be physically present and engaged in MUS 003, COSC 050, and COSC 065. I'm going to set reminders and make sure I'm out the door on time. Beyond that, I need to dedicate specific blocks of time to tackling those upcoming deadlines. I'll probably hit up Sudikoff more for COSC work and make sure I'm reviewing material regularly. I still want to keep up with my social life and activities, because that's a huge part of what makes me happy and energized, but I'll be more intentional about scheduling it around my academic commitments.

I know I'm enrolled in MUS 003, COSC 050, and COSC 065, and I've got the times down, but I've been so incredibly focused on getting things going with the rowing team. The Boathouse has practically been my second home, especially with all the early morning sessions and getting everything organized. It's been a huge commitment, but it feels so good to be back on the water and pushing myself. I also spent a good chunk of time at the Hopkins Center \u2013 there's just so much happening there, and I love soaking it all in. And then there was that deep dive into a personal coding project over in Sudikoff; I just got so absorbed in it that the hours melted away.\n\nI guess the challenge this week has been that intense focus on extracurriculars and personal projects meant that my academic schedule kind of took a backseat. My knowledge score is definitely reflecting that! It's not ideal, especially with all those deadlines popping up.

The holistic approach to solving the \"scattered information\" and \"FOMO\" problem for a specific campus community is a strong differentiator.\n\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?** (6/6)\n    Absolutely. The student clearly and empathetically articulates the common pain points of university students: information overload, scattered event data, difficulty finding relevant opportunities, and the resulting feeling of disconnect or \"FOMO.\" This is a highly relevant and impactful problem to solve.\n\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?** (5/6)\n    The student has done an excellent job identifying the core mobile development concepts and specific technologies (Firebase, map SDKs, calendar APIs) that would underpin each feature. Individually, each listed feature is technically feasible for a student team. The challenge lies in the *breadth* and *integration* of all these features within a single semester. While the student's confidence is commendable, delivering a polished version of *all* proposed features (especially the recommendation engine, real-time chat, and robust user-generated content with verification) would be a significant undertaking. However, a strong Minimum Viable Product (MVP) encompassing the core value proposition is certainly achievable.\n\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?** (4/6)\n    This is where the idea leans towards the ambitious side. It is certainly not too simple, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of mobile development. However, the sheer number of distinct, complex features (personalized recommendations, interactive map, social integration with group chat, calendar sync with conflict detection, and user-generated content with verification) pushes the boundaries of what a student team can realistically deliver to a high standard in one semester. While the vision is excellent, careful prioritization and scoping down to a core set of features for the initial release would be crucial for success.\n\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?** (6/6)\n    Yes, unequivocally. The entire premise of \"Campus Pulse\" is centered around improving the user's experience by making campus engagement effortless, fostering connections, and helping students manage their time and avoid missing out. The focus on personalization, intuitiveness, and community building clearly demonstrates a strong user-centric design philosophy and a desire for positive impact.\n\n**Overall:**\nThis is an outstanding project idea with a clear problem statement, a well-thought-out solution, and a strong understanding of the technical components. The primary challenge will be managing the ambitious scope to ensure a high-quality, deliverable product within the semester timeframe. With careful planning and prioritization, this project has the potential to be truly impactful and showcase a wide array of learned skills."}, "weekly_desc": "Okay, time to get this down. What a week! Honestly, I feel fantastic. My energy levels are through the roof, I've been sleeping like a log, and I'm just genuinely happy. It's been a really positive start, feeling super connected and engaged with everything happening around campus.\n\nThis week felt a bit like a whirlwind of getting settled and really diving into the social scene. I spent a lot of time just exploring and hanging out. I remember being at the Hopkins Center on Wednesday evening \u2013 it's such a vibrant place, always something going on. And then later that night, just chilling in Bartlett Hall, connecting with people. It's been great to meet so many new faces and just feel like I'm part of the community here.\n\nThursday and Friday had a lot of time at the Boathouse, which was awesome. I love being active, and it's been a great way to burn off some of that endless energy. There was also some time spent just enjoying the Zahm Courtyard, soaking up the atmosphere. It's been a really social week, and I feel like I've made some solid connections already. My social battery is definitely fully charged!\n\nNow, for the academic side of things... this is where I need to be really honest with myself. Looking back, I didn't really get into the swing of my classes this week. It says \"no class experience recorded,\" and yeah, that's pretty accurate. I think I got a bit caught up in the excitement of everything else, and maybe underestimated how quickly I needed to shift gears into academic mode. My knowledge score is definitely reflecting that, which is a clear sign I need to step it up.\n\nIt's not a panic, though. I feel calm and ready to tackle it. I'm usually super organized and on top of things, so this week was a bit of an anomaly. It was more about soaking in the new environment and making those initial connections. But now that I've had that \"settling in\" period, it's time to really buckle down.\n\nMy main goal for next week is to get fully immersed in my coursework. I've got MUS 003, COSC 050, and COSC 065, and I need to make sure I'm attending every session and actively participating. There are quite a few deadlines coming up \u2013 a bunch on Friday, some on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. That's a lot to juggle, so I need to map out my study schedule meticulously.
