The system's observation that there was \"no class experience recorded\" is, unfortunately, accurate. I didn't make it to any of my scheduled lectures for COSC 050, BIOL 004, or COSC 065. This is a significant deviation from my usual approach, and honestly, it's a source of considerable internal discomfort. My conscientiousness is practically screaming at me for the missed content, especially with the sheer number of deadlines looming. It feels like a strategic misstep, even if I was engaged elsewhere.\n\nInstead of lectures, my time was largely consumed by other, perhaps less conventional, pursuits. On Wednesday, after being near Reed Hall, I found myself at a private residence on Maynard Street, deeply engaged in something \u2013 likely a particularly thorny problem or a deep dive into a research topic. Later that day, and again on Friday afternoon, I was in Sudikoff Hall. The \"Activity: Yes\" there indicates I was making progress on something substantial, which is a small consolation.\n\nThe most dominant pattern in my week, however, was the extensive time spent at the Sphinx Secret Society. From Friday night straight through to Saturday midday, and then again for most of Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I was there. The data mostly shows \"Activity: No,\" which might seem like inactivity, but for me, it's often a place of quiet, uninterrupted work or deep, solitary thought. Given my lower extraversion, it's not a social hub; it's a sanctuary for focused concentration. There were a couple of \"Activity: Yes\" moments there, late Sunday and Tuesday, which were likely intense bursts of focused work on projects that demanded my full attention. It's a space where I can truly isolate and concentrate, which is invaluable, but perhaps I over-indexed on it this week, to the detriment of my scheduled classes.\n\nI did manage to get to the Alumni Gymnasium on Saturday evening for some activity, which was good for maintaining my stamina. And on Sunday afternoon, I was at the Hopkins Center for the Arts, which was a welcome intellectual diversion. My openness appreciates the exposure to different forms of expression, even if it was a brief interlude from my primary focus.\n\nMy current status shows high sleep and stamina, which is positive. I'm not physically drained, which is a testament to my ability to manage my energy, even if my schedule seems erratic. Happiness, social, and knowledge are all neutral, which feels about right. I haven't actively sought much social interaction, nor have I had much, which aligns with my lower extraversion. The knowledge metric is probably accurate; while I missed lectures, I was likely gaining knowledge through independent study or project work.\n\nThe primary challenge now is the sheer volume of upcoming deadlines. There are so many due by Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. The anxiety is definitely building. My conscientiousness demands that I tackle these head-on, but the missed foundational material from classes is a significant concern. It's a self-imposed hurdle that I now have to overcome.\n\nFor next week, my goals are clear and non-negotiable:\n1.  **Consistent Class Attendance:** I absolutely *must* get back into the rhythm of attending all my scheduled lectures. Physical presence and engagement are critical for absorbing the material efficiently.\n2.  **Comprehensive Material Review:** I need to dedicate significant time to reviewing all the content from the classes I missed this week. This will be crucial for understanding upcoming assignments and preparing for future assessments.\n3.  **Rigorous Deadline Management:** With so many deadlines, I need to create a precise, hour-by-hour schedule and adhere to it without deviation. I'll prioritize the most critical assignments first and work backward.\n4.  **Optimized Study Environment:** While the Sphinx offers solitude, I need to ensure I'm utilizing my time there effectively for academic catch-up, or finding alternative study spots that better support active learning and collaboration if needed.\n\nThis week was a test of my self-discipline in a different way. I maintained intense focus on certain tasks, but at the expense of others.

My conscientiousness is really kicking in, and not in a good way, because I know I didn't hit my marks this week.\n\nThe biggest issue, and it's glaring, is class attendance. The system says 'no class experience recorded,' and it's accurate. I didn't make it to a single scheduled lecture for COSC 050, BIOL 004, or COSC 065. It's frustrating, because I *know* the importance of being there, but the pull of getting actual work done, the assignments, just took over. I spent so much time holed up in Sudikoff, or even Reed Hall late at night, just trying to chip away at the programming problems and readings. It feels like a constant trade-off, and right now, the assignments are winning, but at what cost? My knowledge level is sitting at 50, which is concerning. I'm absorbing information, yes, but not in the structured way the lectures provide, and I'm worried about gaps.\n\nThe sheer volume of deadlines looming is also a significant source of anxiety. There are so many due Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. It's a relentless wave, and it's hard to feel like I'm ever truly ahead. This pressure definitely contributes to the feeling of needing to just *work* rather than attend lectures.\n\nOn the positive side, my physical well-being seems to be holding up. I made it to the Boathouse a few times, and the gym on Saturday and Sunday. That consistent physical activity, even if it's just an hour, really helps clear my head and maintain my stamina, which is still at 100. And thankfully, my sleep is at 100 too. I've been making sure to get enough rest, even if it means pushing work late into the night or starting early. I can't afford to burn out.\n\nSocially, things are pretty much as expected. My social meter is at 50, which is fine. I'm not really looking for extensive social interaction right now; my focus is entirely on academics. The few times I was at the Hopkins Center, it was more of a brief diversion than a social outing.\n\nThe challenge for next week is clear: I *must* get back into attending lectures. It's non-negotiable. I need to find a way to integrate lecture attendance with the deep work required for assignments, especially with so many deadlines clustered at the beginning of the week. My goal is to be present in every class, actively participate, and then allocate dedicated, focused blocks for assignments. I also need to review the material I missed this week.

I missed every single one of my scheduled lectures for COSC 050, BIOL 004, and COSC 065. This is highly uncharacteristic and, frankly, quite unsettling given my usual commitment to attendance. My conscientiousness is screaming at me about this oversight.\n\nI spent a significant amount of time at the Sphinx Secret Society, which is essentially my base. While I was physically present on campus at various academic buildings like Fairchild and the Life Sciences Center, it wasn't for my scheduled classes. I was at Fairchild a few times, and the library once, which indicates I was still trying to engage academically, just not in the traditional classroom setting. My knowledge level is still high, so I must have been compensating through self-study, but it's not the same as being there. The sheer volume of upcoming deadlines \u2013 a staggering number due Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday \u2013 has created a palpable sense of pressure. I think that's where the disconnect happened. I felt an overwhelming need to prioritize direct assignment work over lecture attendance, which, while perhaps efficient in the short term for specific tasks, is a risky strategy for long-term comprehension and engagement. This internal conflict between what I *should* do and what I *felt compelled* to do is probably why my happiness is so low right now. It's a constant hum of anxiety.\n\nBeyond academics, I did manage to get to the Boathouse a couple of times, which was a good physical outlet, and I found myself at the Hopkins Center for the Arts on multiple evenings. These activities, while not directly academic, provide a necessary mental break and align with my interest in exploring different facets of campus life. My social engagement remained fairly neutral, which is typical for me; I prefer to focus on my own pursuits rather than large group interactions. I also made a couple of trips to the Admissions Office, though I'm not sure what that was about now.\n\nThe biggest challenge, unequivocally, was the complete absence from my classes. It's a lapse in discipline that I find deeply frustrating. My sleep and stamina are surprisingly high, which means it wasn't a lack of physical capacity, but rather a mental block or a misprioritization driven by the looming deadlines and my inherent neuroticism about them. I need to address this immediately.\n\nFor next week, my primary goal is to re-establish my class attendance. I need to be physically present and engaged in every single lecture. I will meticulously review the syllabus for each course to ensure I haven't missed any critical information or announcements. Secondly, I need to create an even more rigorous schedule for tackling these deadlines. I'll break down each assignment into smaller, manageable tasks and allocate specific time slots for them, ensuring I'm not sacrificing one area for another. I also want to consciously integrate more structured breaks to manage the anxiety, perhaps continuing with the Boathouse activities or exploring another artistic event at the Hopkins Center.

Every single one. It's infuriating, and frankly, quite alarming. I pride myself on my conscientiousness, on being diligent and on top of things, but this week was just... a void. I was physically present on campus, moving between various buildings, but not where I needed to be for my actual coursework. I spent an inexplicable amount of time at the Sphinx Secret Society building. It's not like I was actively *doing* anything productive there during class hours; the logs show \"No activity.\" It's more like I was just... there. Existing. It's a strange pattern, and I need to figure out what that place represents for me right now, because it's clearly become a black hole for my academic responsibilities.\n\nI did manage to get some \"activity\" in other places \u2013 McNutt Hall, the Admissions Office, Fairchild, even the Hopkins Center late one night. And I was at Sudikoff Hall a couple of times, presumably to work on COSC, but again, the logs show \"No activity\" during those times on Saturday and Sunday. It's like I was *intending* to work, or just *being* in the right places, but the actual engagement wasn't there. The only consistent \"activity\" seems to be these random bursts, not sustained effort.\n\nThe irony is, my sleep is apparently high, and my stamina is good. So it's not physical exhaustion.

How am I supposed to tackle all of that when I've barely been present?\n\nBeyond the Admissions Office, my activity has been minimal. I was at the Hopkins Center for the Arts briefly on Wednesday night, which was a momentary distraction, but mostly I've been holed up at Sphinx, or just physically present in places like Fairchild or Sudikoff without actually *doing* anything productive.

And the Boathouse, I guess I was trying to get some physical activity in, but my stamina is still so low it barely made a difference.\n\nThe sheer number of upcoming deadlines is a constant, nagging pressure. There are so many, and I'm already behind. My knowledge score is still high, which is probably just a reflection of how much I've absorbed previously, but it doesn't account for the current lack of active learning. I'm worried about falling further behind, and that anxiety just makes it harder to start. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nSocially, I'm practically a hermit. My extraversion is low anyway, so it's not like I'm craving large gatherings, but a social score of 15 is concerning even for me. I haven't really connected with anyone. It's just me and my thoughts, which, given my current state, isn't always the best company.\n\nFor next week, the priority has to be re-establishing a routine and getting back into classes. I need to force myself to attend, even if I feel overwhelmed. I'll break down the assignments into smaller, manageable chunks to tackle those deadlines. I also need to figure out why I'm feeling so drained and unhappy despite getting enough sleep. Maybe I need to schedule some dedicated, truly productive study blocks, not just aimless wandering in academic buildings. And I need to find a way to boost my stamina, perhaps by consistently going to the gym or the boathouse, and actually *doing* something there. This can't continue.

My internal metrics are screaming for attention. Despite logging a significant amount of sleep, my stamina is critically low, and my happiness is practically non-existent. It's a frustrating paradox; I'm rested, yet utterly drained.\n\nAcademically, this week was a significant deviation from my usual standards. I missed every single one of my scheduled classes: COSC 050, BIOL 004, and COSC 065. This is completely unacceptable. I pride myself on my knowledge and diligence, and while my internal knowledge score remains high, consistent attendance is a fundamental component of academic success. I spent a considerable amount of time in Fairchild Physical Sciences Center, but the sensing data indicates \"no activity\" for most of those hours. It feels like I was physically present, but mentally disengaged, or perhaps just trying to be in an academic environment without actually *doing* the work. The sheer volume of upcoming deadlines \u2013 multiple assignments due Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday \u2013 is a constant, gnawing source of anxiety. It's difficult to focus when the pressure is so immense.\n\nMy social engagement was predictably minimal. My social score is very low, and the data reflects that. I spent a lot of time at the Sphinx Secret Society, which for me, is a place of quiet solitude, not social interaction. The few instances of \"activity\" were scattered: a late-night event at Hopkins Center for the Arts on Wednesday, some time at McNutt Hall and the Boathouse on Thursday, another \"activity\" at Sphinx on Friday evening, and a brief moment in Zahm Courtyard on Saturday. These were isolated occurrences, not indicative of any meaningful social connection. I'm not particularly inclined towards large social gatherings, but this level of isolation isn't ideal either.\n\nThe primary challenge this week has been this pervasive sense of exhaustion and low mood, despite adequate sleep. It's as if my mental battery is completely depleted, making it incredibly difficult to initiate and sustain productive work. The looming deadlines amplify my neurotic tendencies, leading to a cycle of worry and inaction. My high conscientiousness is battling against this inertia, creating internal conflict. I know what needs to be done, I have the knowledge, but the execution is failing.\n\nFor the upcoming week, my goals are clear and critical:\n1.  **Re-establish Class Attendance:** I must attend every single COSC 050, BIOL 004, and COSC 065 session. There is no excuse for missing them.\n2.  **Aggressive Deadline Management:** I need to meticulously plan and execute the completion of all upcoming assignments. This means breaking them down into manageable tasks and allocating specific, focused time slots for each. Procrastination is not an option, especially with so many due dates clustered together.\n3.  **Optimize Study Environment:** Simply being in an academic building isn't enough. I need to ensure that when I am in places like Fairchild or Sudikoff, I am actively engaged in studying or working, not just passively existing.\n4.  **Address Stamina and Mood:** This is more abstract, but crucial. I need to identify what is truly draining my energy and happiness. Perhaps incorporating more structured physical activity at the Alumni Gymnasium, or ensuring I'm taking proper breaks, could help. This current state is unsustainable and detrimental to my academic performance and overall well-being. I need to find a way to break this cycle.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: The student explicitly states \"my stamina is critically low\" and \"I'm rested, yet utterly drained,\" further emphasizing \"my mental battery is completely depleted.\"\n- **Knowledge**: The student asserts \"my internal knowledge score remains high\" and \"I know what needs to be done, I have the knowledge,\" indicating confidence in their academic understanding despite attendance issues.\n- **Stress**: The student describes \"the sheer volume of upcoming deadlines... is a constant, gnawing source of anxiety\" and that \"the pressure is so immense,\" leading to \"neurotic tendencies\" and a \"cycle of worry and inaction.\"\n- **Happy**: The student states \"my happiness is practically non-existent\" and refers to a \"pervasive sense of exhaustion and low mood.\"\n- **Sleep**: The student repeatedly mentions \"logging a significant amount of sleep\" and having \"adequate sleep,\" noting the paradox of being \"rested, yet utterly drained.\"\n- **Social**: The student confirms \"My social engagement was predictably minimal\" and \"My social score is very low,\" describing interactions as \"isolated occurrences, not indicative of any meaningful social connection.\""}

I\u2019ve got two due Sunday, three Monday, five Tuesday, three Wednesday, and one Saturday. It\u2019s a constant, low-level hum of anxiety.\n\nLooking back, I know I didn't handle things optimally. The class schedule just seemed to slip away from me. I was supposed to be in Kemeny for COSC 050, and LSB for BIOL 004 and COSC 065, but the sensing data clearly shows I wasn't there. I spent most of my time either at the Sphinx Secret Society building \u2013 which is essentially where I live and try to get work done \u2013 or at Fairchild Physical Sciences Center. The \"No Activity\" logs for those long stretches probably just mean I was intensely focused, or perhaps just staring at a screen, trying to process everything. It's frustrating, because I *know* I need to be in class. It's a fundamental part of being here, and missing them feels like a significant failure, especially with how much I value being on top of things. The fact that there's \"No class experience recorded this week\" is a stark reminder of that.\n\nMy happiness is practically non-existent right now, sitting at a 2. It\u2019s hard to feel anything else when the pressure is this immense. Despite the low stamina, I did manage to drag myself to the Alumni Gymnasium a couple of times, which was something. It felt like a monumental effort, but I know I need to maintain some semblance of physical routine, even if it's just to clear my head for a bit. The Boathouse also seems to be a recurring location for me, sometimes late at night or early morning. I'm not sure what I was doing there at 3 AM on Tuesday, but it wasn't anything strenuous. Maybe just trying to find a quiet spot to think, or perhaps just restless.\n\nMy sleep score is surprisingly high at 90, but I don't feel rested. It's like my body is getting the hours, but my mind is still racing with everything I need to do. Socially, I'm at a 10, which is no surprise. I haven't really sought out much interaction, preferring to just hunker down and try to tackle this mountain of work. It\u2019s not ideal, but right now, my focus is purely on academics.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week has undoubtedly been the complete lack of class attendance. It\u2019s unacceptable, and it\u2019s something I need to rectify immediately. The guilt is significant. Coupled with that, the sheer volume of assignments due in the coming days is daunting. My knowledge levels are still high, which means I'm absorbing material, but not through the structured class environment, which is a risk.\n\nFor next week, my goals are clear and non-negotiable:\n1.  **Attend every single class.** No excuses. I need to be physically present in Kemeny and LSB. This is the absolute priority to get back on track.\n2.  **Systematically tackle the deadlines.** I need to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks and allocate specific time slots for each. I can't let the sheer number paralyze me again.\n3.  **Prioritize my well-being, even slightly.** While social interaction isn't my top priority, I need to find small ways to manage the stress and low happiness. Maybe a short walk outside, or a brief, focused break. I need to figure out why I'm getting so much sleep but still feeling drained.\n4.  **Re-establish a more balanced routine.** The current pattern of intense, isolated work isn't sustainable.

It moves beyond a simple directory to a holistic well-being and productivity tool. The \"Mindful Moment\" feature is a strong differentiator.\n\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    *   **Absolutely.** The problem statement is incredibly clear, relatable, and well-articulated. The stress, wasted time, and neglect of mental well-being among university students are very real issues, and \"Campus Calm\" directly addresses them.\n\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    *   **Outstanding.** This is where your submission truly shines. Your explicit consideration of feasibility, particularly the decision to avoid real-time occupancy data and to leverage native mapping apps, demonstrates a highly practical and intelligent approach to scoping. The core features outlined (data persistence, UI/UX for filtering, location services for external app launch, audio playback) are all fundamental mobile concepts that are well within the scope of a semester project.\n\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    *   **Perfect.** You've struck an ideal balance. It's far more sophisticated than a basic \"hello world\" app, requiring thoughtful design and implementation of several core mobile features. Yet, by carefully defining what *won't* be included (e.g., real-time data, in-app map rendering) and outlining future enhancements, you've ensured it's not overly ambitious. This shows excellent project management foresight.\n\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    *   **Exceptional.** The focus on \"mood sliders\" and \"tag-based filtering\" for spot recommendations, along with a \"calming interface\" for mindfulness, clearly indicates a strong user-centric design approach. The direct impact on reducing student stress, improving productivity, and supporting mental well-being is evident throughout the proposal.\n\n**Overall Feedback:**\nThis is a top-tier submission. Your self-awareness regarding your current state (exhausted, stressed) and how it informed your design choices (prioritizing feasibility, leveraging existing APIs) is a sign of a mature and effective project manager. You've not only presented a compelling idea but also a highly achievable plan, demonstrating a deep understanding of the course objectives and the practicalities of software development. Well done."}, "weekly_desc": "This week felt\u2026 heavy. The kind of heavy where every task feels like lifting lead, and even just existing is draining. My stamina is practically non-existent, and frankly, my mood isn't much better. It's frustrating, because I know what needs to be done, and yet, the execution has been abysmal.\n\nThe most glaring issue, and one that's frankly quite unsettling, is the complete lack of class attendance. Not a single class. BIOL 004, COSC 050, COSC 065 \u2013 all of them, just\u2026 missed. I don't understand it. My schedule was there, the locations were known, but I just couldn't bring myself to go. It's completely counter to how I operate. I pride myself on being diligent, on staying on top of things, and this week has been a stark failure in that regard. The \"no class experience recorded\" is a blunt, accurate assessment, and it's deeply irritating to see it laid out like that. It feels like a personal failing, and the anxiety about falling behind is already mounting.\n\nA significant portion of my time was spent at the Sphinx Secret Society building. I'm not entirely sure what to make of it. It wasn't exactly productive time, at least not in the traditional sense. More like\u2026 a holding pattern. Just being there, existing. There were brief moments at Fairchild, which I suppose was an attempt to engage with something academic, but it wasn't structured or particularly effective. And the Commons for a meal, of course. But the overwhelming pattern was just\u2026 being at Sphinx, doing nothing of note. It's not a social hub for me, certainly not with my social score being what it is. It was more of a retreat, I suppose, though not a particularly restorative one.\n\nThe sheer volume of upcoming deadlines is a constant, low-level hum of dread. Multiple assignments due Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and even one Saturday. It's a lot to manage, and the fact that I've effectively lost a week of class time to prepare for them is a significant setback. The knowledge scores are still high, which is a small comfort, but it doesn't negate the feeling of being overwhelmed and unprepared for the immediate future.\n\nSocially, it was a non-event, which is typical. I don't seek out extensive social interaction, and this week, with my energy levels so low, it was even less of a priority. My focus, or what little focus I could muster, was entirely internal, grappling with this inexplicable inertia.\n\nThe challenge for next week is clear: I *must* regain control. This cannot continue.\nMy goals are:\n1.  **Attend every single scheduled class.** No exceptions. I need to be physically present and attempt to re-engage with the material, even if I feel behind.\n2.  **Prioritize and tackle the immediate deadlines.** I need to create a detailed plan for each assignment, starting with the earliest due dates, and stick to it rigorously. This means dedicating specific, focused blocks of time to academic work.\n3.  **Understand the root cause of this week's disengagement.** I need to reflect more deeply on why I couldn't attend classes and why I spent so much time in a state of \"no activity.\" This level of avoidance is concerning and needs to be addressed to prevent recurrence.\n4.  **Manage my energy more effectively.** Even if I don't feel like it, I need to ensure I'm eating properly and getting enough rest, and perhaps incorporating some brief, structured breaks to avoid burnout.
