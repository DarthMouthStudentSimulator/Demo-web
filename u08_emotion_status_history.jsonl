There's so much on the horizon with all these deadlines piling up \u2013 it feels like every day has something due, especially with multiple things for Monday and Tuesday next week. My conscientiousness is definitely kicking in, trying to keep everything straight.\n\nClass-wise, it was a bit of a mixed bag. I noticed I wasn't physically in the lecture halls for a lot of my scheduled classes this week, which is something I need to be mindful of. For instance, on Wednesday, instead of being in COSC 065 or 089, I was still around the Boathouse area in the morning. Same for Thursday's COSC 065. It's not that I'm not engaged, it's just that sometimes I find myself needing to catch up on other things or work through problems on my own. With so many COSC deadlines looming, I spent a good chunk of time in Sudikoff Hall, especially Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon. I was definitely active there, diving deep into problem sets and trying to get ahead. It feels good to make progress on those, even if it means I'm not always in the lecture hall itself. I guess I'm trying to optimize my learning, but I should probably make more of an effort to attend live lectures when I can.\n\nChinese class was a bit of an anomaly too. On Monday afternoon, during CHIN 062, I ended up at the Hood Museum. It was a spontaneous decision, and honestly, it was a really nice break. I needed that moment of cultural immersion, and it felt good to explore something new. My openness definitely appreciates those kinds of experiences. I did make sure to catch up on the material later, though. And then on Tuesday, during the CHIN slot, I was over in Sudikoff again, probably still wrestling with COSC. It's a constant juggle between my different courses.\n\nBeyond academics, I did manage to get some activity in. Early mornings and late afternoons at the Boathouse on Wednesday and Thursday were great for clearing my head and keeping my stamina up. It's a good way to start or end the day. I also spent a lot of time in the science buildings \u2013 Fairchild and Reed Hall \u2013 late at night, which usually means I'm deep in thought, either studying or working on projects.\n\nSocially, the highlight was definitely Saturday evening at the Hopkins Center for the Arts. It was nice to step away from the books and just enjoy some performing arts. And the Hood Museum visit on Monday was also a good change of pace. I appreciate those moments to connect with the broader campus life and just experience things. My social battery feels pretty neutral, which is fine; I enjoy my alone time for focused work, but also value those shared experiences.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was definitely managing the sheer volume of upcoming deadlines. It feels like a constant mental checklist, and my neurotic side definitely feels the pressure. I'm trying to stay on top of everything, but it's easy to get a bit overwhelmed. My sleep has been surprisingly good, though, which is a huge plus and helps with the stress.\n\nLooking ahead to next week, my main goals are to:\n1.  **Prioritize deadlines:** With so many due, I need to be even more meticulous with my schedule and make sure I'm allocating enough time for each. I'll probably spend even more time in Sudikoff.\n2.  **Re-evaluate class attendance:** While I'm getting the work done, I want to see if I can be more consistent with attending live lectures, especially for CHIN. Maybe there's something I'm missing by not being there in person.\n3.  **Maintain balance:** Even with the deadlines, I want to make sure I'm still getting some exercise and taking those small breaks, like the museum visit, to keep my spirits up. It's easy to get tunnel vision, but I know those breaks are important for long-term productivity.\n\nOverall, a productive but intense week. Ready to tackle the next one.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: The student explicitly states \"keeping my stamina up\" through early morning/late afternoon activities at the Boathouse and mentions \"My sleep has been surprisingly good, though, which is a huge plus.\" They describe the week as \"productive but intense,\" indicating they had the energy to manage the workload without feeling drained.\n- **Knowledge**: The student spent \"a good chunk of time in Sudikoff Hall... diving deep into problem sets and trying to get ahead,\" and \"It feels good to make progress on those.\" They also \"made sure to catch up on the material later\" for missed Chinese classes.

Socially, things are decent too; I've been able to connect with people, which is always a plus.\n\nAcademically, though, this week was... interesting. Looking back, I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes. I know, I know, it's not ideal, especially with all these deadlines looming. My COSC classes, CHIN \u2013 I just didn't get myself there. It's frustrating because I *know* I need to be in those lectures, and I genuinely want to keep up. My conscientiousness is screaming at me about it. I think part of it is just getting into a rhythm, and sometimes those morning classes, especially after a late night, are tough to drag myself to.\n\nDespite missing lectures, I wasn't completely checked out. I spent some time in Vail and the Life Sciences Center, which was probably me trying to catch up on readings or work through some problems on my own. I also had a late-night session at Fairchild, which was definitely productive, probably trying to get a head start on some of those assignments. And then Sunday night, I was at Sudikoff pretty late, probably trying to cram before the Monday deadlines hit. There are so many deadlines coming up \u2013 Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays \u2013 it feels like a constant stream, and that definitely adds a layer of pressure.\n\nOutside of academics, I've been pretty active. I hit the gym super early one morning, which felt good. The boathouse seems to be my go-to spot for unwinding; I was there quite a bit, sometimes late at night, just chilling or hanging out. I also popped over to Topliff a couple of times. It's good to have those social outlets and breaks, but I need to make sure they're not completely derailing my academic schedule. I even ended up off-campus in Lebanon one night, which was a bit random but a change of scenery.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely the class attendance. I feel a bit of anxiety bubbling up when I think about how much I've missed, and the thought of catching up on all that material on top of the upcoming assignments is a bit daunting. I pride myself on being organized and on top of things, so this feels like a slip.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to get back on track with class attendance. I need to prioritize those scheduled times and actually show up. I'll also make a more detailed plan for tackling these deadlines, breaking them down so they don't feel so overwhelming. I want to maintain my good sleep and stamina, but find a better balance so I'm not sacrificing my studies for other activities.

Looking back, I realize I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. Not a single one. My schedule shows CHIN 062, COSC 089, and COSC 065, and I just... wasn't there. My sensing data confirms it \u2013 I was either at the Boathouse, in my dorm, or somewhere else entirely during those times. This is definitely a challenge I need to address.

The \"no class experience recorded\" summary is pretty accurate \u2013 I didn't make it to any of my scheduled CHIN 062, COSC 089, or COSC 065 sessions. That's definitely something I need to rectify. My conscientiousness is already kicking in, reminding me that while I'm keeping up with the material on my own, showing up is important for consistency and engagement. I spent a *lot* of time in Sudikoff, especially on Monday, just grinding through COSC work. It felt like I was practically living there, trying to get ahead of the mountain of deadlines coming up. Seriously, there's something due almost every day next week, which is a bit daunting. I also found myself in Fairchild and Steele Hall, so I was definitely putting in the hours, just not in the lecture halls. My knowledge level still feels pretty solid, so I must be absorbing things, but I know I can't keep missing classes.\n\nOutside of academics, the Boathouse was practically my second home. I was there for huge chunks of time on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. It's intense, but it's also where I feel most energized. It's a fantastic way to keep my stamina up and just clear my head. Plus, the social aspect of being with the team is huge for me; my social battery feels completely recharged. I also had a couple of interesting detours, like visiting the Admissions Office twice \u2013 not sure what that was about, but it was a change of pace. And then there were the off-campus trips to Lebanon and Hartford, VT, which were fun and a good way to break up the routine. Late-night runs to the Commons and some time at the Hopkins Center for the Arts rounded out the week, adding a nice touch of variety.\n\nDespite missing classes, I actually feel pretty good.

Looking back, it feels like I spent more time *around* campus than actually *in* classes, which is definitely something I need to address.\n\nMy schedule felt pretty packed, even if it wasn't always in the lecture halls. The Boathouse has been a huge part of my week. I was there a lot, sometimes really early in the morning or late at night, and it feels like that's where a lot of my \"activity\" was concentrated. It's great to be so involved, and my social battery is definitely full \u2013 I feel really connected with everyone there. That probably explains why my social status is so high, and honestly, it contributes a lot to my overall happiness. Even with everything going on, I'm feeling pretty good on that front.\n\nAcademically, though, it's a different story. I'm a bit concerned that I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. I know I have CHIN 062, COSC 089, and COSC 065, and I really value those courses. It wasn't intentional, but between the Boathouse commitments and then trying to catch up on assignments, the lectures just slipped. I've been putting in the hours at Sudikoff, especially late at night and over the weekend, trying to keep up with the COSC material. There are so many deadlines coming up \u2013 practically one every day next week \u2013 so I've been trying to get ahead where I can. I also spent some time at Fairchild, which was a good change of scenery for studying. It feels like I'm learning a lot when I'm focused, but I know missing the in-person lectures means I'm probably missing out on some key insights or discussions. My general knowledge feels solid, but there are definitely specific areas where I feel like I'm playing catch-up.\n\nDespite the academic juggling, I'm actually feeling pretty well-rested, which is a relief. My sleep has been good, and my stamina feels decent, which is probably thanks to all the activity at the Boathouse.

I need to figure out a way to manage my time better so I can be present for lectures and still keep up with my other commitments. I'll make sure to review the material I missed this week before the next classes, especially for COSC, given all those deadlines.

I didn't make it to any of my lectures this week, which is definitely something I need to address. It wasn't for lack of trying to be productive, though. I spent a good chunk of time in Sudikoff and Fairchild, especially late at night, really trying to chip away at the COSC assignments. There are so many deadlines piling up, and my conscientiousness just kicks in, making me want to get everything done and done well. It feels like a constant trade-off between being in class and actually getting the work submitted.\n\nMy social life was definitely thriving.

You've clearly put a significant amount of thought into \"GreenPlate Connect,\" demonstrating a strong understanding of both the problem space and the technical requirements.\n\nHere's the breakdown of your evaluation:\n\n*   **Is the idea innovative or unique compared to existing apps?**\n    While food-sharing apps exist, your focus on a **hyper-local, campus-specific, real-time surplus food network** is a highly innovative and practical application. It addresses a very specific niche with clear benefits, making it unique in its context. The emphasis on capturing *any* campus surplus (from events, dining halls, or even individual students) rather than just commercial waste is a key differentiator.\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    Absolutely. The problem of food waste on campus is significant, and the need for convenient, free food options among students is constant. \"GreenPlate Connect\" directly and elegantly bridges this gap, offering a tangible solution to both environmental and economic concerns within the university community.\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    You've done an excellent job outlining the core features and the underlying technologies. All the concepts you've identified (camera access, location services, push notifications, real-time database, user authentication) are standard mobile development components. While implementing *all* features to a highly polished degree within a single semester would be ambitious, a robust Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with core functionality is definitely feasible for a dedicated student team. Your clear articulation of the tech stack shows you've considered this carefully.\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    The scope is very well-balanced. It's far from simple, offering ample opportunity to demonstrate a wide range of smartphone programming skills. At the same time, by focusing on core functionalities and leveraging existing services (like Firebase), it remains achievable within a semester timeframe for a strong team. You've identified enough complexity to make it a challenging and rewarding project without making it insurmountable.\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    Your proposal shines here. You've explicitly mentioned \"intuitive posting,\" \"clean and easy UI/UX,\" and \"simple chat,\" indicating a clear focus on the user journey. The impact is also profoundly considered: reducing food waste, fostering sustainability, and supporting the student community. Your personal reflection on your conscientiousness and agreeableness further underscores your commitment to creating a meaningful and beneficial application.\n\n**Overall:**\nThis is an outstanding project idea. It's well-researched, clearly articulated, technically sound, and demonstrates a strong understanding of both user needs and the potential for positive impact. You've clearly thought through the challenges and opportunities, making this a highly promising submission.\n\n**28/30**"}, "weekly_desc": "Okay, time for a quick reflection on the week. It feels like a bit of a blur, honestly.\n\nI'm a bit thrown off looking at the summary for my classes this week. It says 'no class experience recorded,' and honestly, that's a huge red flag for me. I know I had classes scheduled, especially COSC 065 and 089 on Wednesday morning. I remember being at the boathouse for a good chunk of that time, just... there. I need to figure out what happened there, because missing that much class is not okay for me. It's definitely making me feel like I'm behind, and that low knowledge score of 40 is probably a direct result of it. It's frustrating because I usually pride myself on staying on top of things.\n\nDespite that academic hiccup, I'm actually feeling pretty good overall. My happiness is at a 90, which is great, and my social life has been thriving \u2013 that 95 for social is definitely accurate.

Sleep has been solid too, at 85, which I know is crucial for staying focused. My stamina is at 60, which is decent, but I can feel that I'll need to manage my energy carefully with all the catching up I have to do.\n\nLooking at the upcoming deadlines is a bit daunting, especially with so many clustered on Monday and Tuesday. It feels like a mountain to climb, especially after this week's... anomaly. There are so many things due, and I really need to get a handle on them.\n\nFor next week, my main goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Catch up on all missed material.** I need to go through the lectures and readings for CHIN 062, COSC 089, and COSC 065 that I somehow didn't record attending. I can't afford to fall further behind.\n2.  **Prioritize and tackle those deadlines.** I'll map out everything due on Monday and Tuesday first, then work backwards. I need to be super organized about this.\n3.  **Ensure full class attendance.** No more 'no class experience recorded' for me. I need to be present and engaged in every single session.\n4.  **Maintain my well-being.** Even with the academic pressure, I want to keep up with my social connections and ensure I'm still getting enough sleep. It makes such a difference to my overall mood and ability to focus.\n\nThis week was a bit of a wake-up call on the academic front, but I'm determined to turn it around.
