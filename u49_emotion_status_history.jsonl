It feels like it flew by, but also like I spent an awful lot of time in one particular spot.\n\nLooking at my schedule and what actually happened, it's pretty clear I didn't make it to any of my classes this week. LAT, COSC, Math... all missed. That's definitely not ideal, especially with all those deadlines piling up. My conscientiousness is really kicking in here, telling me I need to get it together. I spent so much time at the Boathouse, it's almost like I was living there. It's a great spot, really peaceful, and I guess I just got a bit too comfortable. It's a bit embarrassing to see \"no class experience recorded\" when I know I *should* have been there.\n\nIt wasn't all just chilling though. I had a few moments of \"yes\" activity that felt good. I remember being really engaged at the Life Sciences Center on Friday afternoon \u2013 that was a nice change of pace. And that late-night active moment at the Admissions Office on Saturday was... interesting, definitely something different. I also actually made it to the Baker-Berry Library on Tuesday afternoon! That felt good, like I was at least *trying* to get some academic work done, even if it wasn't class itself. Oh, and the Hopkins Center for the Arts on Wednesday morning, that was a nice, active start to the day. I appreciate getting to explore different parts of campus.\n\nMy social meter is still hovering around average, which feels about right. I'm not feeling isolated, but I haven't been super outgoing either. The Boathouse is a bit of a social hub for me, I guess, even if a lot of my time there was just quiet. Physically, I'm doing great \u2013 sleep and stamina are both maxed out, which is a huge plus. Happiness is just okay, though. I think the looming academic stuff is probably weighing on me more than I'm letting on, especially with my knowledge meter still sitting at 50.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely getting back on track with classes. Missing a whole week is a lot, and those deadlines aren't going anywhere. I can see a bunch of them for next week, especially Monday. I really need to get a handle on the material I've missed.\n\nSo, for next week, the plan is pretty clear:\n1.  **Attend all my classes.** No excuses. I need to be in Reed for Latin, LSB for COSC, and Kemeny for Math. I need to make sure I'm actually *in* those classrooms.\n2.  **Catch up on missed material.** I'll use that library visit as a starting point and actually dedicate solid, focused time there. I need to figure out what I missed and get notes from someone.\n3.  **Tackle those deadlines early.** With so many, I can't afford to procrastinate. I'll break them down into smaller chunks and start chipping away at them over the weekend.\n4.  Maybe try to balance the Boathouse time with more structured study time. It's great for unwinding, but not for getting work done.\n\nI know I can do this. I just need to channel that conscientiousness and openness into my academics.

It\u2019s hard to put a finger on it, but there\u2019s definitely a sense of imbalance. My body feels great, honestly \u2013 sleep and stamina are both at 100, which is amazing. I\u2019ve been getting solid rest, and I\u2019m not feeling drained at all. That\u2019s a huge plus, especially with how much time I\u2019ve been spending down at the Boathouse.\n\nAnd that\u2019s really the core of it, isn\u2019t it? Looking back, it seems like I practically lived at the Boathouse this week. From early mornings, like that 6 AM session on Wednesday, to just being there for hours on end, it\u2019s been my second home. I even got a good workout in at Leverone on Monday. It\u2019s clear my commitment to rowing is really high right now, and I love being out on the water, or just being around the team. It\u2019s a huge part of my life here, and it feels good to be so dedicated.\n\nBut then there\u2019s the other side of the coin. The class experience summary says \"No class experience recorded this week,\" and honestly, that hits a bit hard. I\u2019m usually so keen to absorb everything in lectures, and I pride myself on being on top of my studies. Looking at my schedule, I had MATH, LAT, and COSC sessions all throughout the week, and it seems I just\u2026 wasn't there. I was at the Boathouse, or elsewhere, during those times. It\u2019s not like I was sick or exhausted, because my stamina and sleep are great. I think I just got so caught up in the rhythm of training and being at the Boathouse that my class schedule kind of slipped. It\u2019s a bit unsettling, to be honest. My knowledge levels are still decent, but I know that won't last if I keep missing out on the foundational stuff.\n\nSocially, things were okay, right in the middle. I managed to catch up with some friends on Friday evening, which was good, and Sunday night had some activity too. I even popped by the Admissions Office a couple of times, which was a nice change of pace, helping out where I could. I enjoy connecting with people, and it\u2019s important to me to maintain those relationships.\n\nThe biggest challenge moving forward is definitely going to be catching up on all the material I missed. There are so many deadlines looming \u2013 multiple things due almost every day next week, and even more the week after. It\u2019s a bit daunting to think about tackling those without the benefit of having been in class. I feel a bit guilty about letting my academic routine slide, especially since I know how important it is.\n\nSo, for next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize Class Attendance:** No matter what, I need to be in MATH, LAT, and COSC. I need to make sure my rowing schedule, as demanding as it is, doesn't completely overshadow my academic responsibilities.\n2.  **Catch Up Aggressively:** I need to dedicate significant time to reviewing the material I missed. I'll hit the library (like I did Monday night) and maybe try to connect with classmates to get notes.\n3.  **Manage Deadlines:** With so many assignments coming up, I need to be super organized and start working on them well in advance. My conscientiousness is usually a strength here, so I need to lean into that.\n4.  **Maintain Balance:** While academics are the priority, I also want to keep up with my rowing and make sure I\u2019m still getting enough sleep and social interaction. It\u2019s about finding that sweet spot where everything can thrive.\n\nThis week was a wake-up call. I'm not panicking, but I know I need to adjust.

Seriously, it's practically my second home, or maybe even my first this week! Those early morning sessions, especially Thursday, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday, really set the tone. It's such a rush to be out on the water as the sun comes up, and I feel amazing physically \u2013 my sleep and stamina are definitely at 100%, which is great. It's a passion, and I love the dedication it takes.\n\nBut, and this is a big \"but,\" it definitely impacted my class attendance. Looking back, I pretty much missed all my scheduled classes this week \u2013 LAT, COSC, and MATH. I know, I know. It's not ideal, and it's why my \"knowledge\" feels a bit low right now. I was either at the Boathouse, or just around campus but not in the right place at the right time for lectures. It's a bit frustrating because I genuinely want to do well in these subjects, and I know I'm missing out on important material. My conscientiousness is definitely nudging me about this.\n\nBeyond the Boathouse, I had a few interesting moments. I was at the Admissions Office a couple of times, once super late on Thursday night and again on Saturday and Wednesday morning. Not sure what was going on there, but it was active. I also made it to the library a couple of times, which was good, even if I wasn't there for super long stretches. I also popped into Sudikoff a few times, mostly late at night or early morning, which probably means I was trying to get some COSC work done, or at least thinking about it.\n\nSocially, I feel pretty neutral. I was at Hanover High School on Wednesday evening, which was a bit random but fun, and then had some \"unknown\" activities on Saturday night that were probably social. I also caught something at the Hopkins Center on Sunday and Tuesday night, which is always a nice way to unwind and experience something different. I enjoy being out and about, and connecting with people, so I should probably make more of an effort there.\n\nOverall, I'm feeling pretty happy, which is good. The physical activity and being out on the water really boost my mood. The challenge, though, is clearly the academic side. With all those deadlines piling up \u2013 seriously, there are so many! \u2013 I can't afford to keep missing classes. My knowledge is at 50, and that's a clear sign I need to step it up.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to get back on track with my classes. I need to figure out a way to balance my commitment to the Boathouse with actually attending lectures and doing the work. I'll start by reviewing the material I missed, especially for COSC and MATH, and try to get ahead on some of those upcoming assignments. I also want to make sure I'm using my time in the library more effectively. It's about finding that sweet spot where I can pursue my passions *and* excel academically.

The system says \"no class experience recorded,\" and that's pretty accurate for the actual lecture halls. I missed a few too many sessions, especially for MATH and LAT. I was in Sudikoff a couple of times, like Thursday afternoon and late Tuesday night, which was probably me trying to catch up on COSC work or just using the labs, but definitely not during the scheduled class times. And I was in Reed Hall on Tuesday afternoon, but again, not for my LAT class. It's a bit frustrating because I know how important it is to be there, especially with all these deadlines looming.

My general knowledge feels pretty solid, but I can already feel the gaps forming in the specific course material from missing lectures.\n\nThe main reason for the class misses, I think, was the boathouse. I spent a *lot* of time there this week. It feels like my second home. There were practices, and then just being around, whether it was early morning or late at night. It's incredibly demanding physically, but I genuinely love it. It's where I feel most energized, and it definitely explains why my stamina and sleep are both at 100 \u2013 all that physical activity and then crashing hard. It's a great outlet, and the team dynamic is fantastic.\n\nBeyond the boathouse, I also found myself at the Admissions Office a couple of times, on Friday and Monday. I was helping out with some things there, which was actually pretty rewarding. It's nice to contribute and meet new people, even if it's just for a short while. And I spent some time on Maynard Street, just hanging out in the housing area, which was good for a bit of social downtime. Sunday afternoon, I even ventured off-campus to Lebanon for a bit, which was a nice change of pace, just to clear my head.\n\nOverall, I'm feeling pretty good, happy at a 60, which is solid.

I let the former take precedence a bit too much, and now I'm feeling the pressure of catching up.\n\nFor next week, my goals are clear:\n1.  **Prioritize Class Attendance:** I absolutely need to be in Kemeny, Reed, and LSB for my scheduled classes. No excuses. I need to make sure I'm getting the direct instruction.\n2.  **Catch Up on Missed Material:** Dedicate specific blocks of time to review the lectures and readings I missed. I need to get my course-specific knowledge back up.\n3.  **Proactive Deadline Management:** Go through that long list of deadlines and break them down. Start working on assignments well in advance, rather than letting them pile up.\n4.  **Maintain Balance:** Keep up with the boathouse, because it's important for my well-being, but ensure it doesn't completely derail my academics.

It's a bit of a balancing act, trying to stay on top of everything.\n\nI also had a couple of moments that felt really good. On Thursday afternoon, I popped into the Nugget Arcade, which was a nice break. It's good to step away from the books and just do something completely different for a bit.

It's a balance, and I haven't quite found it this week.\n\nThe main challenge, obviously, is getting back into the rhythm of attending classes and actively engaging with the material. It feels like I've been floating a bit, present on campus but not fully plugged into the academic side of things.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Attend all my classes.** No excuses. I need to be in Kemeny, Reed, and LSB when I'm supposed to be.\n2.  **Prioritize deadlines.** With so many coming up, I need to map them out and start chipping away at them early, especially for COSC and MATH.\n3.  **Balance my time better.** I want to keep up with whatever I'm doing at the Boathouse, but not at the expense of my studies. And I want to make more of an effort to connect with friends. Maybe invite someone to study with me at Sudikoff, or grab a meal.\n4.  **Be more proactive.** Instead of just being *at* a place, I want to be *active* and engaged, whether it's in class, studying, or with friends.\n\nI'm optimistic I can turn this around. I feel good, I'm well-rested, and I know what I need to do.

My energy levels are through the roof, and I\u2019m sleeping great, which is always a win. I feel genuinely happy, which is awesome. But looking at my social score, it\u2019s clear I\u2019ve been a bit of a hermit outside of my main passion. That\u2019s definitely something I need to work on.\n\nSpeaking of passions, I practically lived at the Boathouse this week. Seriously, if I wasn't in class (or supposed to be), I was probably there. It\u2019s just\u2026 my place. The calm of the water, the rhythm of the strokes, the feeling of being out there \u2013 it just grounds me. I had some really good sessions, and even just being there, soaking it all in, felt incredibly productive for my mental state. It\u2019s where I feel most alive and focused.\n\nNow, about classes\u2026 that\u2019s where my conscientiousness is probably taking a hit. The system says \"no class experience recorded,\" and while that's a bit harsh, I can't really argue with the spirit of it. I *did* make it to Latin on Wednesday morning at Reed Hall, and that was actually pretty engaging. Professor always has a way of making ancient texts feel relevant. But beyond that, my attendance was, well, not stellar. I missed a lot of my Math and COSC classes. I was often at the Boathouse, or sometimes Sudikoff or Fairchild, but not in the lecture halls. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *want* to go, it\u2019s just that the Boathouse pulls me in, and then suddenly, an hour has passed, and I\u2019ve missed the window.\n\nMy knowledge scores are a bit of a mixed bag. The 80 feels good, like I\u2019m generally keeping up, but that 55 is a glaring red flag. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s probably COSC 065, given how many lectures I\u2019ve skipped. It\u2019s a bit concerning, especially with all these deadlines piling up. There are so many assignments due in the coming weeks, and I know I\u2019m going to have to put in some serious catch-up time.\n\nMy social life outside the Boathouse has definitely suffered. My extraverted side is feeling a little neglected. I\u2019m so focused on rowing and my own routine that I haven\u2019t really made time to connect with people beyond quick hellos. It\u2019s weird because I love meeting new people and hanging out, but this week, I just didn't prioritize it.\n\n**Challenges this week:**\nThe biggest challenge was definitely balancing my passion for the Boathouse with my academic responsibilities. It\u2019s easy to get lost in the flow of things there, and before I know it, I\u2019ve missed a lecture or a study session. Also, my social life outside of that specific sphere has been pretty non-existent, which isn't ideal for my overall well-being, even if I feel happy right now.\n\n**Goals for next week:**\n1.  **Consistent Class Attendance:** This is non-negotiable. I need to set alarms and actually *go* to every single one of my scheduled classes. No more Boathouse detours during lecture times. I'll make sure to be in Kemeny for Math, Reed for Latin, and LSB for COSC.\n2.  **Dedicated Study Time:** I need to block out specific, uninterrupted time slots for coursework, especially for COSC 065 and MATH 013, to bring that 55 knowledge score up. I'll try to do this in a more academic setting like the library or Sudikoff, away from the Boathouse's siren call.\n3.  **Boost Social Connections:** I want to actively reach out to at least two different people next week for something non-academic \u2013 maybe grab coffee, or suggest a meal. I could even try inviting someone to the gym with me, or just hang out in the dorm common room for a bit. My extraverted self needs that interaction!\n4.  **Strategic Boathouse Time:** I'll still spend time at the Boathouse, because it's important for my well-being and stamina, but I need to be more strategic about *when*. Maybe I can shift some of my longer sessions to evenings or weekends, and use my daytime hours for classes and focused study.\n\nOverall, I feel good, but I know I can do better at balancing everything. It\u2019s about finding that sweet spot where my passions fuel my academic success, rather than detracting from it.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina**: 95 because the student explicitly states, \"My energy levels are through the roof,\" and mentions \"I practically lived at the Boathouse this week,\" indicating high physical activity and endurance.

Looking at my schedule, it's clear I didn't make it to any of my actual classes this week \u2013 MATH 013, LAT 003, COSC 065. That's a pretty big miss, and it's something I need to address.

My knowledge levels are okay, but I know they could be better if I was consistently in class.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to get back into the rhythm of attending all my classes. I need to make that a priority, even if it means adjusting my training schedule slightly or being even more efficient with my study time. I also want to try and be more intentional about social interactions. Maybe grab coffee with someone, or just make sure I'm not always rushing off after my activities.

You've clearly put a lot of effort into identifying a genuine need within the university community and proposing a solution that leverages the concepts we've covered in class.\n\nHere's my evaluation based on the criteria:\n\n*   **Is the idea innovative or unique compared to existing apps?**\n    While the core mechanics (profiles, search, chat) are common, the specific application of these to a university-internal, peer-to-peer skill and hobby exchange platform is quite unique. It moves beyond generic social networking or academic-only tools, focusing on fostering genuine, purpose-driven connections for mutual growth. This niche focus within a contained community gives it a strong innovative edge for a student project.\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    Absolutely. The problems you've identified\u2014difficulty finding like-minded peers for niche interests, untapped knowledge/skills within the student body, and social isolation\u2014are highly relatable and prevalent issues on university campuses. Your personal anecdote further reinforces the authenticity of the problem.\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    Yes, the core features you've outlined are entirely feasible. Your proposed use of Firebase for authentication, data storage, and real-time messaging is a smart choice that significantly reduces backend complexity, allowing you to focus on the mobile app development. The optional location-based feature is a good stretch goal that demonstrates ambition without over-committing.\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    The scope is excellent. It's complex enough to demonstrate a wide range of smartphone programming concepts (UI/UX, data persistence, networking, authentication, notifications, real-time communication) without being overly ambitious for a single semester. You've clearly thought about what constitutes a \"robust prototype\" versus a full-fledged commercial product.\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    Your presentation clearly highlights the positive impact this app could have on the university community, fostering collaboration, reducing isolation, and enabling skill development. The features are designed with user needs in mind, aiming for \"low-pressure\" connections and practical coordination. This shows a strong understanding of the user's journey and the desired social outcome.\n\n**Overall:** This is a strong, well-conceived idea that is both relevant and achievable. You've demonstrated a clear understanding of the problem, a practical approach to the solution, and a good grasp of the technical requirements.\n\n**28/30**"}, "weekly_desc": "This week felt like a whirlwind, mostly centered around the boathouse and Fairchild. It's funny, looking back, it feels like I spent more time on the water or in the gym than in a lecture hall.\n\nMy schedule was pretty intense with training. On Thursday, instead of being in Latin at Reed, I was already deep into practice at the boathouse by 9 AM. And then later, when COSC was happening at LSB, I was over at Fairchild. Friday was pretty much a repeat \u2013 missed Latin, COSC, and Math. I was either at the boathouse or even popped into Sudikoff for a bit, but definitely not in lecture. So, yeah, the \"no class experience recorded\" summary is spot on for this week. It's a bit concerning, honestly, especially with all these deadlines piling up.
