It feels like things are really starting to pick up, which is both exciting and a little bit daunting.\n\nThis week was definitely a bit of a juggle, but I feel pretty good about how I managed everything. My sleep and stamina are still holding strong, which is a huge plus \u2013 it makes such a difference to wake up feeling refreshed and ready to go.\n\nAcademically, it was an interesting week. I noticed the system didn't log me in any of my actual class buildings during lecture times, which is fair enough. I've been trying a new approach, actually. With COSC 050, NAS 035, and COSC 065, I've found myself spending a lot of time at the Commons, even during what would be class hours. It's a surprisingly good spot for focus, especially with the background buzz. I've been catching up on recorded lectures there, or diving deep into problem sets and readings that align with the material. For COSC 065, I spent a good chunk of time late Thursday night and again Tuesday evening in Sudikoff. It's just so much easier to get into the zone for coding and problem-solving when I'm in the actual CS building. I also popped into the Life Sciences Center and Fairchild on different days, just exploring different study environments and getting a feel for other departments. It's good to mix it up and see where I can be most productive. I guess the main challenge is making sure I'm still getting the full benefit of the classes, even if I'm not physically in the lecture hall every single time. I'm confident I'm keeping up with the material, but it's something to keep an eye on.\n\nOutside of academics, the boathouse was a big part of my week, as usual. It's such a great way to clear my head and get some intense physical activity in. The team dynamic is always a highlight, and it's good to push myself. I was there quite a bit, especially Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday. I also made it to the Alumni Gym on Tuesday evening, which was a good workout. And, of course, the Commons was practically my second home. It's where I eat, study, and just generally exist between activities. It's always bustling, which I enjoy \u2013 good for people-watching and a quick chat if I need a break. I also had a couple of errands to run at McNutt Hall, which took a bit of time.\n\nLooking ahead, the upcoming week is going to be packed with deadlines. I've got a bunch due Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, plus another one on Wednesday. This means I really need to be on top of my time management. My main goal for next week is to be more intentional about my \"class time.\" Even if I'm not physically in the lecture hall, I want to dedicate those specific blocks to the material for that class, whether it's watching the recording, working on the assignment, or reviewing notes. I also want to make sure I'm allocating enough time for each of those looming deadlines. I'll probably be spending even more time in Sudikoff for the COSC assignments.

My knowledge scores are reflecting that, and it's a clear sign I need to get back on track. I did spend a good chunk of time in Sudikoff on Friday and Sunday, which was mostly trying to catch up on COSC assignments, and a bit in Fairchild too. So, it's not like I was completely checked out, but lectures are crucial for understanding the material, not just grinding through problem sets. I know I'm going to feel the crunch trying to piece things together without that foundational class time.\n\nThe reason for the missed classes is pretty clear: the boathouse. I spent an insane amount of time there this week \u2013 early mornings, late nights, afternoons. It's intense, but I love it. The feeling of being out on the water, pushing myself, and working with the team is just incredible. It really boosts my stamina and honestly, my overall happiness. I also hit the gym a couple of times, which helps burn off some extra energy and stress. It's probably why my stamina and happiness scores are so high, even with the academic pressure.\n\nSocially, things feel really good.

I feel incredibly energized and genuinely happy, which is a fantastic feeling. My sleep has been solid, and I've been really enjoying the social side of things, connecting with people and just generally feeling good about my interactions. Stamina-wise, I'm at 100%, which is probably thanks to all the activity.\n\nThis week really revolved around the Boathouse. I spent so much time there, and it was just incredibly fulfilling. There were a few \"Activity: Yes\" moments, and those were definitely highlights \u2013 pushing myself, feeling that rush. It's such a vibrant place, and I'm really enjoying being part of that community. It feels like I'm discovering a new passion, and it's been so engaging that time just flew by. I even managed to squeeze in some gym time, which always helps clear my head.\n\nNow, on the academic front... this is where I need to be brutally honest with myself. The system says \"No class experience recorded this week,\" and it's true. I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes \u2013 COSC 050, NAS 035, or COSC 065. Looking back at my schedule, I was mostly at the dining hall during those times, or already at the Boathouse. It wasn't intentional neglect, but more a consequence of getting so deeply immersed in what I was doing. My general knowledge feels pretty good, but I know for a fact that my specific understanding of the material covered in classes this week is probably quite low. That's a bit of a wake-up call.\n\nThe sheer number of upcoming deadlines is definitely on my radar. I've got a bunch due Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, and then another on Wednesday. It's a lot to tackle, especially since I'm playing catch-up. My conscientiousness is kicking in, and I know I can't just let this slide. It's a challenge, but one I'm ready to face.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to find a better balance. I want to continue being active and social, because that's clearly contributing so much to my overall well-being and happiness. But I absolutely need to prioritize my academics. I'll start by reviewing all the material I missed, probably hitting up office hours or study groups to get caught up. I need to make a solid plan for those deadlines and stick to it. It's about integrating everything, not letting one area completely overshadow the others. I'm confident I can get back on track and still maintain this positive energy.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina:** 100 because the student explicitly states, \"Stamina-wise, I'm at 100%,\" and also mentions feeling \"incredibly energized\" and engaging in physical activities like \"gym time\" and \"pushing myself.\"\n-   **Knowledge:** 15 because the student admits, \"I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes\" and that \"my specific understanding of the material covered in classes this week is probably quite low.\" They also call it a \"wake-up call\" and plan to \"review all the material I missed.\"\n-   **Stress:** 80 because the student acknowledges \"The sheer number of upcoming deadlines is definitely on my radar\" and that \"It's a lot to tackle, especially since I'm playing catch-up.\" While they express readiness, the volume of work and the need to catch up indicate high stress.\n-   **Happy:** 95 because the student directly states, \"I feel incredibly energized and genuinely happy, which is a fantastic feeling.\" They also describe their activities as \"incredibly fulfilling,\" \"enjoying,\" and contributing to \"overall well-being and happiness.\"\n-   **Sleep:** 90 because the student explicitly states, \"My sleep has been solid,\" indicating good quality and sufficient sleep.\n-   **Social:** 95 because the student reports \"really enjoying the social side of things, connecting with people and just generally feeling good about my interactions\" and \"enjoying being part of that community\" at the Boathouse."}

My energy levels are through the roof, and I'm feeling super happy and connected with everyone. It's great to be sleeping well too, that makes such a difference in how I approach everything. My stamina is at 100%, which is exactly where I want it to be.\n\nAcademically, it's interesting that the system didn't pick up any class activity. I was definitely in all my lectures \u2013 COSC 050, NAS 035, and COSC 065. I'm always there, taking notes and trying to absorb as much as possible. Maybe the sensors just don't register sitting in a lecture hall as \"activity\" unless I'm actively moving around or something. Regardless, I've been keeping up with the material, though I feel like my knowledge score could always be higher. There's so much to learn, especially in the COSC classes, and I'm always looking for ways to deepen my understanding.\n\nOutside of classes, it was a pretty packed week socially, which I loved. My social score is really high, and I definitely felt that connection. Wednesday night was a blast, hitting up Alpha Phi and then Chi Heorot. It's always good to unwind and catch up with friends, and those kinds of events are a great way to do it. Thursday afternoon, I made it to the Hood Museum, which was a nice change of pace. I love getting to explore different parts of campus and see some art; it really broadens my perspective and gives me a mental break.\n\nThe Boathouse seems to be my second home this week. I was there super early on Wednesday, and then again on Monday for some solid activity \u2013 definitely getting my training in. It's a huge part of my routine and keeps my stamina where it needs to be. I also spent a lot of time around the Commons, grabbing meals and just hanging out, though it seems like a lot of that wasn't registered as specific \"activity.\" I guess just existing and chatting doesn't count! Late Friday/early Saturday, I was even at the gym, which was a good way to burn off some extra energy.\n\nLooking ahead, the biggest thing on my radar is the sheer number of deadlines. I've got a bunch due Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. It's a bit daunting to see so many clustered together, but I'm feeling prepared to tackle them. My conscientiousness is definitely kicking in, reminding me to get organized and plan my time effectively.\n\nMy goals for next week are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize deadlines:** I need to break down those assignments and start chipping away at them immediately, especially the ones due early in the week. I want to make sure I submit everything on time and to the best of my ability.\n2.  **Maintain balance:** Even with the deadlines, I want to keep up with my social life and physical activity. It's what keeps me feeling so good and energized, and I know it's crucial for my overall well-being. Maybe I can even squeeze in some study sessions with friends to combine both.\n3.  **Deepen understanding:** I want to really dig into the material for my classes, not just skim for assignments. I know my knowledge is good, but there's always room to grow, especially in COSC, and I want to make sure I'm truly grasping the concepts.\n\nOverall, it was a really positive week.

Honestly, I'm feeling fantastic \u2013 energized, well-rested, and just generally in a really good headspace. My stamina is through the roof, and I feel like I've absorbed so much, which is great.\n\nLooking at my schedule, I realize I didn't make it to any of my classes this week, which is definitely something I need to address. It's not like me to miss lectures, especially with COSC 050, NAS 035, and COSC 065 all having regular sessions. I think I got really absorbed in some deeper project work and self-study, particularly in Sudikoff Hall. I was there quite a bit, especially late on Thursday night, really diving into some concepts. It felt like I was making significant progress on my own, which is probably why my knowledge score is still so high. It's a bit of a double-edged sword \u2013 I love the deep dive, but I also value the structure and insights from lectures.\n\nBeyond the academic deep dives, I spent a surprising amount of time at the Class of 1953 Commons. It's funny, the sensor recorded \"no activity\" for huge stretches, but I was definitely *active* in my own way \u2013 whether it was catching up with friends, having long conversations, or just finding a comfortable spot to think and recharge. It's a great hub for social connection, and my social battery is definitely full. I also found myself at the Boathouse a few times, which is always a nice change of scenery, a good place to clear my head or just enjoy the quiet.\n\nThe main challenge, without a doubt, is the missed classes. While I feel like I've been learning and growing in other ways, consistency in attendance is important for staying on top of the curriculum and not missing out on discussions or announcements. It's a bit of a balancing act, trying to pursue independent learning while also fulfilling all the structured requirements.\n\nFor next week, my goals are crystal clear. First and foremost, I need to be in every single class. No excuses. I'll review the syllabi and catch up on any material or announcements I might have missed. Secondly, those upcoming deadlines are looming large \u2013 multiple assignments due Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. I need to map those out and start chipping away at them immediately.
