I definitely kept myself busy, which I appreciate.\n\nAcademically, it's interesting to see \"no class experience recorded.\" I mean, I know I have COSC 065 scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings, and Thursday afternoon. I was in Sudikoff a few times, and even in the Life Sciences Center on Wednesday afternoon, but I guess the system didn't log any of it as a formal \"class experience.\" That's something I need to keep an eye on. I'm usually pretty diligent about attending and engaging, so if it felt like I wasn't getting much out of it, or if I missed something, I need to make sure I'm on top of that next week. It's important to me to make the most of my classes, especially COSC.\n\nOutside of classes, the Boathouse was definitely a central part of my week. Monday evening, Tuesday morning at 3 AM (yes, 3 AM!), and then again Tuesday evening \u2013 it was a lot of time down there. Those early morning practices are brutal, but there's something really satisfying about being out on the water when everyone else is still asleep. It's a good way to start the day, even if it means sacrificing a bit of sleep. It keeps my stamina up, that's for sure.\n\nI also spent a fair bit of time at the Admissions Office. I was there for a good chunk of Tuesday afternoon, and then had some activity logged there in the evening. It's always interesting to see what goes on behind the scenes, and I feel like I'm contributing, which is nice.\n\nOverall, I feel pretty balanced. My sleep and stamina are good, which is crucial for managing everything. Happiness and social levels are moderate, which feels about right for this point in the semester \u2013 busy, but not overwhelmed.\n\nMy main challenge for the week, looking back, is making sure I'm truly *engaging* with my academic schedule. Even if I'm physically present, I need to ensure I'm getting the most out of COSC 065. It's a core class, and I want to build a solid foundation.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize COSC 065:** I need to make sure I'm fully present and engaged in all my scheduled COSC classes. I'll review the syllabus and make sure I'm caught up on any material I might have missed or not fully absorbed.\n2.  **Maintain the balance:** Keep up with my Boathouse commitments and the work at the Admissions Office, as they're important to me, but ensure they don't overshadow my academic responsibilities.\n3.  **Proactive learning:** Maybe spend some dedicated time in Sudikoff for self-study or to review lecture notes, even if it's not a formal class. Just to make sure I'm really internalizing the material.\n\nIt was a productive week in many ways, and I'm ready to tackle the next one with a renewed focus on academics.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina:** The student explicitly states, \"It keeps my stamina up, that's for sure\" and \"My sleep and stamina are good,\" indicating high energy levels despite a busy schedule with early morning Boathouse practices.\n-   **Knowledge:** The student expresses concern about \"truly *engaging* with my academic schedule\" and needing to \"ensure I'm getting the most out of COSC 065\" and \"review the syllabus and make sure I'm caught up on any material I might have missed or not fully absorbed,\" suggesting a perceived gap in knowledge absorption despite physical presence in classes.\n-   **Stress:** The student explicitly states feeling \"busy, but not overwhelmed\" and \"pretty balanced,\" indicating a low level of stress and good management of commitments.\n-   **Happy:** The student describes the week as \"a whirlwind, but in a good way, mostly,\" and explicitly states \"Happiness and social levels are moderate, which feels about right,\" reflecting a generally positive and balanced emotional state.\n-   **Sleep:** The student explicitly states \"My sleep and stamina are good,\" despite mentioning \"sacrificing a bit of sleep\" for early morning practices, indicating overall sufficient and restorative sleep.\n-   **Social:** The student explicitly states \"Happiness and social levels are moderate, which feels about right,\" suggesting a balanced and acceptable level of social interaction for them this week, even though the journal focuses more on individual activities."}

Looking back, it was packed, but maybe not always in the ways I intended.\n\nAcademically, I'm a bit frustrated with myself. I didn't make it to any of my COSC 065 classes this week. I know the schedule, and I had every intention of being there, but things just kept pulling me in other directions. It's not like I was just lounging around; I was definitely active. I spent a good chunk of time at the Admissions Office, which is always busy, and I was at the Boathouse a lot. I think that's where a lot of my time went, especially with those late-night and early-morning sessions. It's a big commitment, but I really enjoy being out on the water, and my stamina feels great from it.\n\nI did make it to the Life Sciences Center a few times, but those weren't for COSC. I was hoping to get some independent work done there, maybe catch up on some readings or problem sets, but I don't feel like I made as much progress as I should have. My knowledge levels are still pretty low, which is a clear sign I need to buckle down. It's a bit concerning, especially with how much I value staying on top of things.\n\nSocially, it felt pretty average. I had a couple of meals at the Commons, and there were a couple of times I was out at \"unknown\" locations, which probably means I was with friends or just doing something off-campus. I'm generally happy, and I'm getting plenty of sleep, which is good. It's not like I'm burning out, but I do feel a bit of a disconnect between my intentions for academics and where my time actually went.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was definitely prioritizing. I have these commitments that I really care about, like the Boathouse and the Admissions Office, and they just ended up taking precedence over my scheduled classes. It's not a habit I want to get into, especially with how important COSC 065 is. I feel a bit guilty about missing those lectures.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to get back on track with COSC 065. I need to make sure I'm in class for every session. I'll also dedicate specific, uninterrupted blocks of time to catch up on what I missed and really dig into the material. I need to figure out a better way to balance my Boathouse schedule and my Admissions Office work with my academic responsibilities, so I'm not sacrificing one for the other.

It's nice to feel so well-rested and ready to go.\n\nBut then there's the class situation. And honestly, it's the biggest thing I need to address. COSC 065? Yeah, I completely dropped the ball. I missed every single one of my scheduled classes this week. That's just not like me, and it's been nagging at the back of my mind. I know my knowledge scores are reflecting that, and it's a clear sign I need to step it up. I did try to compensate a bit by heading over to Sudikoff Hall late Sunday night, trying to wrap my head around some of the concepts I've missed. It felt good to at least *try* to catch up, but it's definitely not the same as being there for the lectures.\n\nMost of my time, as usual, was spent at the Boathouse. It's my comfort zone, and I get a lot done there, even if it's just chilling out. I also spent a fair amount of time at the Admissions Office throughout the week. I think I was helping out with some things there, which I enjoy, but maybe I let those commitments, or just being comfortable, take precedence over my actual class schedule. I also popped over to the Tuck School of Business briefly and McNutt Hall, so I was moving around campus a bit.\n\nSocially, things felt pretty balanced. I made it to the Sarner Underground on Saturday, which was a nice change of pace and good to be around people. And I was at the dining hall a couple of times, so I wasn't completely isolated.

Secondly, I'm going to dedicate specific blocks of time to review all the material from this past week that I missed. I want to see those knowledge scores climb back up.

It feels like it flew by, honestly. Overall, I'm feeling pretty good, well-rested, and my energy levels are high, which is always a plus.\n\nLooking back at the schedule, it's clear where my focus has been. I spent a *lot* of time at the Boathouse this week. Those early morning sessions are tough, but getting out on the water, especially at 5 AM on Friday, really sets the tone for the day. And then the afternoon practices, like Monday and Tuesday, they just eat up so much time. It's demanding, but I genuinely enjoy it, and it keeps my stamina up. I even got a session in at Leverone Field House on Friday, which was a good change of pace.\n\nThen there's the Admissions Office. I was there a surprising amount, especially in the evenings and late nights. It's a bit of a mystery why I was there so much, but I definitely had some activity there on Tuesday and Wednesday. It must be something I'm committed to, maybe a job or a volunteer role, because I was there for long stretches.\n\nNow, for the classes... this is where I need to be honest with myself. My COSC 065 schedule is pretty consistent \u2013 Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. And I didn't make it to any of them. Not a single one. I was either at the Boathouse or the Admissions Office during those times. It's not ideal, and my conscientiousness is definitely kicking in here. I know I need to be in class, especially for COSC. I did make it to Sudikoff Hall on Friday evening, which was good, probably to catch up or work on something, but it's not the same as being in lecture. ENGS 031 is still a complete unknown, so that's not even on my radar yet.\n\nThe \"no class experience recorded\" summary is a stark reminder. It's a bit concerning, especially since I'm usually on top of things. My knowledge level isn't exactly soaring right now, and missing lectures isn't going to help that.\n\nSocially, things felt pretty balanced. I had that activity on Friday evening that was off-campus, which was nice. I'm not the most outgoing person, but I appreciate connecting with people when I do.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was clearly balancing my commitments outside of academics with actually attending classes. I'm doing well physically and mentally, but my academic presence was definitely lacking.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize COSC 065:** I need to make it to every single COSC 065 lecture. No excuses.

Maybe I can ask a classmate for notes or check if lectures are recorded.\n3.  **Investigate ENGS 031:** I really need to find out what's going on with ENGS 031. It's still TBA, and I can't keep ignoring it.\n4.  **Allocate dedicated study time:** Beyond just attending class, I need to schedule specific blocks for studying and working on assignments, especially for COSC.\n\nI'm feeling good, but I know I can't let my academic responsibilities slide like this.

My social battery is also doing well, so that's nice.\n\nHowever, looking back, I definitely need to address my class attendance. It's not like me to miss things, especially when I know how important it is to stay on top of the material. The data shows I didn't make it to my COSC 065 lectures on Thursday or Monday, and I didn't have any recorded class experience at all this week. That's a bit concerning for someone who prides themselves on conscientiousness. I'm not entirely sure what happened, but I know I was spending a lot of time down at the Boathouse and even at the Admissions Office. It feels like I got a bit sidetracked, or maybe just lost track of time with other activities. I did make it to Sudikoff Hall on Tuesday, which is the CS building, so I was at least in the right vicinity, even if not in class.\n\nSpeaking of the Boathouse, I spent a significant amount of time there. It's a great place to be, and I had a couple of active moments there on Sunday and Monday evenings. I also found myself at the Admissions Office quite a bit, even having an active moment there on Sunday afternoon. I'm not sure what exactly I was doing, but it seems I was quite engaged in those spaces. My time in the dorm was limited to one active moment on Monday evening, which probably means I was out and about a lot.\n\nSocially, things seem to be going well. My social score is good, and while the data doesn't explicitly show specific social events, those \"Activity: Yes\" moments at unknown locations on Tuesday evening could very well have been with friends. I generally enjoy connecting with people, and I feel like I've been able to do that this week.\n\nThe main challenge, as I said, is the missed classes. My knowledge score isn't super high, and missing lectures certainly won't help that. It's a bit frustrating because I know I can do better.\n\nFor next week, my primary goal is to get back on track with COSC 065. I need to make sure I'm in class for every session and catch up on anything I missed. I'll also try to figure out what ENGS 031 entails, as it's still a bit of a mystery. Beyond academics, I want to maintain this good balance of happiness, sleep, and stamina.

I did make it to COSC 065 on Wednesday morning, which was good. Being in Sudikoff Hall for that class, and then spending a lot of time there later in the week, really helped me feel like I was engaging with the material. I was definitely putting in the hours, especially those late nights in the CS building, trying to get a handle on things. It feels like I'm making progress, even if my overall knowledge score isn't skyrocketing just yet.\n\nHowever, I have to admit, I missed COSC on Friday and Monday. That's something I really need to work on. With ENGS 031 still being a bit of an unknown in terms of schedule, COSC is my main structured academic commitment right now, and I need to be more consistent. It's not like I was just slacking off, but I need to prioritize getting to those lectures.

The idea of suggesting optimal study blocks based on user preferences and integrating \"brain breaks\" directly into the workflow is a thoughtful and unique angle that goes beyond simple aggregation. It addresses the fragmentation of existing solutions in a user-centric way.\n\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?** (6/6)\n    Absolutely. The problem statement is highly relatable and clearly articulated: the constant juggle of university life, fragmented solutions, and the need for better time management, study environment discovery, and mental well-being support. This app directly targets these pain points.\n\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?** (6/6)\n    The student has done an excellent job of outlining the core features using standard mobile development concepts (local data persistence, UI/UX, notifications, location services, media playback, widgets). Crucially, they have also wisely identified potential future enhancements that are *beyond* the scope of a single semester, demonstrating a realistic understanding of project limitations and a focus on a robust client-side prototype. This shows excellent planning.\n\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?** (6/6)\n    The scope is perfectly balanced. It's far more complex and engaging than a basic CRUD app, requiring integration of multiple APIs and thoughtful UI design. Yet, by focusing on client-side implementation and deferring complex backend integrations, it remains highly achievable within a semester. The listed features provide ample opportunity to demonstrate a wide range of mobile development skills.\n\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?** (5.5/6)\n    Yes, the proposal consistently emphasizes user experience (\"intuitive platform,\" \"clear, interactive,\" \"contextual information,\" \"immediate visual cues\"). The impact on students' academic success and mental well-being is a central theme, highlighting how the app would reduce stress, improve efficiency, and promote healthier habits.
