I'm feeling pretty good overall, actually \u2013 my energy levels are still super high, which is always a plus.\n\nAcademically, it was\u2026 interesting. I have to admit, I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. I know, I know, it sounds bad, and it's definitely something I need to get a handle on. It wasn't intentional, really. It just felt like every time a class was about to start, I was either deep in conversation with friends at the Commons, or I got completely absorbed in something else. Like, on Thursday and Friday, I was just hanging out at the Commons for hours, and then suddenly it was past class time. Same thing Monday morning. It's easy to get caught up when there's always something going on. I did make it over to the Life Sciences Center a couple of times, and even Sudikoff, to get some actual work done, which felt productive. I also popped into the Admissions Office a few times \u2013 just helping out with some stuff, which was fun.\n\nMy social life, on the other hand, was thriving! I spent so much time at the Class of 1953 Commons, it practically became my second home. Seriously, I was there at all hours, from early morning to late at night, just chatting with people, grabbing food, or sometimes even trying to get some studying in, though that was less successful. There were a couple of late nights there where I was really active, just hanging out and talking with friends. And the Boathouse! I was there a lot too, which is always a great way to clear my head and get some fresh air. Saturday evening was a bit of a blur, just out and about, doing things, which was a blast. It\u2019s great to feel so connected to everyone here.\n\nThe main challenge, obviously, is the classes I missed. It\u2019s starting to weigh on me a little, especially seeing all those deadlines piling up for next week. There are so many things due on Monday and Tuesday, and then more on Wednesday and Saturday. I know I need to catch up on the material I missed, and fast.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is to get back on track with my academics. I really need to prioritize attending all my classes \u2013 no more getting sidetracked by the Commons, at least not during class times! I also need to dedicate some serious time to tackling those assignments. I'm going to make a detailed plan for each day to ensure I hit all those deadlines. I want to keep up with my social life too, because that's important for my happiness, but I need to find a better balance. It\u2019s all about managing my time better, I guess.

Seriously, it felt like my second home, especially on Wednesday morning and then again late into the night on Monday. It's just such a good spot to grab food, catch up with friends, or just chill. I even ended up at the Boathouse a couple of times late at night, which was pretty spontaneous and fun. The highlight of my week outside of campus was definitely heading to that pottery studio on Wednesday night. It was a bit of a trek, but totally worth it \u2013 something different and really relaxing. I love trying new things like that.\n\nAcademically, this week was... interesting. I'm realizing I didn't make it to a single one of my scheduled classes, which is a bit of a wake-up call. I mean, I was around campus, like at the Life Sciences Center a few times on Wednesday and Tuesday afternoon, and even Reed Hall on Friday, but those were outside of my actual class times. I guess I was trying to catch up or work on stuff independently, but it's not the same as being in lecture. My knowledge stats are a bit all over the place, and I can definitely feel that gap from not being in class. It's not ideal, especially with so many deadlines piling up. Seriously, looking at all those Monday and Tuesday deadlines is a bit daunting.\n\nI think I got a little too caught up in the social scene and just enjoying the campus vibe. My sleep has been pretty solid, and my stamina is through the roof, so it's not like I was too tired. I just need to find a better balance.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to get back on track with classes. I really need to make it to EARS, SPAN, and COSC lectures. I also need to dedicate some serious time to tackling those upcoming assignments. I'm going to try to use those academic building visits *during* class times, not just after.

I spent so much time at the Commons this week, just hanging out with friends, grabbing meals, and chatting. It\u2019s such a great vibe there, and I really thrive on that kind of connection. My stamina feels super high too, which is probably why I was able to keep going even with some late nights.\n\nAnd speaking of late nights, I had some really fun, creative moments this week. I ended up at the Davidson Pottery Studio a few times \u2013 Saturday evening, then again Monday morning, and even Tuesday night! It\u2019s such a cool escape, just getting my hands dirty and making something. It really helps me clear my head and just enjoy the process. I also managed to squeeze in some time at Leverone Field House on Tuesday, which felt good to get some exercise in.\n\nNow, for the academic side of things\u2026 this is where it gets a little real. It\u2019s interesting that the system didn't record any \"class experience\" for me this week. I mean, I was definitely around campus and trying to get work done. I spent a good chunk of time in the Life Sciences Center on Wednesday, Monday, and Tuesday afternoons, and even pulled some late nights in Fairchild and Sudikoff working on COSC stuff. That Monday night in Sudikoff was definitely a grind, trying to get ahead of some of those deadlines.

My knowledge scores definitely reflect that, and it\u2019s something I need to address.\n\nThere are so many deadlines coming up, especially a bunch for Monday and Tuesday next week, plus a few for Wednesday and Saturday. It\u2019s a lot to juggle, and I can feel that little bit of pressure building.

I want to make sure I'm not just physically present, but mentally engaged in EARS, SPAN, and COSC. I need to get a solid plan together for all those upcoming assignments and start chipping away at them early, rather than leaving things to the last minute. I still want to make time for my friends and pottery, because those things keep me balanced and happy, but I need to find a better rhythm for academics.

I noticed the system didn't record any class attendance for me this week, and yeah, that's pretty accurate. With so many deadlines piling up, especially for COSC, I ended up making some tough choices. I spent a *lot* of time in Sudikoff, especially late Sunday night and Monday night, just grinding away on those assignments. It felt like a race against the clock with all those Monday and Tuesday deadlines. I know I probably should have been in EARS and SPAN, but I just felt like I had to prioritize getting the COSC stuff done and submitted. It's a bit of a trade-off, and I definitely felt that pressure. My knowledge in COSC feels like it's been a bit of a rollercoaster \u2013 some parts click, others feel like I'm starting from scratch, which probably explains that weird knowledge stat.\n\nOutside of the academic crunch, I made sure to keep up with my social life, which is super important to me. I was at the Commons a lot, grabbing meals and just hanging out with people. It's such a central spot, and it's easy to bump into friends there. I also managed to make it to the Sphinx Society on Tuesday, which was a really cool experience and a nice break from studying. And I think I swung by the Boathouse a couple of times too, just enjoying being out and about. Even though I was pulling some late nights, I still managed to get a decent amount of sleep, which I'm grateful for. It helps keep me feeling energized and ready to tackle the next thing.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was definitely balancing the immediate demands of assignments with the long-term benefit of attending lectures. It's a tricky line to walk, especially when you have multiple things due at once. I felt a bit of a crunch, but I think I managed it okay, given the circumstances.\n\nLooking ahead to next week, my main goal is to get back into a more consistent class attendance routine. I really don't want to fall behind in EARS or SPAN, so I need to figure out a better way to manage my time so I can be in class *and* get my assignments done without feeling so overwhelmed. Maybe I need to start those assignments even earlier, or break them down into smaller chunks. I also want to keep up with the social stuff, because that really helps me stay happy and balanced.

That project was just eating my brain, and with so many deadlines piling up for Monday, I just had to push through. I was so focused on getting that done that I completely missed my EARS and SPAN classes. It felt like a necessary evil at the time, but looking back, I probably could have managed my time a bit better to avoid that.\n\nThen, the rest of the week just kind of\u2026 happened. I ended up taking a spontaneous trip to that pottery studio in Vermont on Monday evening and Tuesday. It was so much fun, a really great way to de-stress and just be creative, and I got to hang out with some awesome people. My social score is through the roof right now, which is fantastic! But yeah, that meant I missed more classes on Tuesday. EARS and SPAN again. It\u2019s not ideal, and I definitely feel a little pang of guilt about it, especially with all the upcoming deadlines. There are so many things due on Monday and Tuesday next week, plus another one on Wednesday and Saturday. It's a bit daunting when you look at it all.\n\nDespite the academic juggling act, I did manage to stay pretty active. Hit the gym on Thursday, and spent a good chunk of time at the boathouse, which always feels great. My stamina is still high, so that's a win!

It feels like it just flew by, but in the best way possible. Honestly, I'm feeling pretty great right now, super happy, which is awesome. Campus life has been buzzing, and I've definitely been soaking it all in.\n\nClasses were pretty standard this week. EARS, SPAN, and COSC all had their usual rhythm. I feel like I'm keeping up, especially in COSC, which is good because those deadlines are no joke. Speaking of COSC, I spent a good chunk of Monday night in Sudikoff, just grinding away. It was late, but I actually don't mind those focused sessions when I'm in the zone. It felt productive, especially with a bunch of stuff due on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nMy social battery is definitely fully charged, which is probably why I'm feeling so good! I spent a lot of time just hanging out with people. The boathouse was a nice chill spot on Saturday and again on Tuesday evening, just enjoying the vibe. And the dining hall... wow, I practically lived there for a bit on Tuesday! I mean, I was there for hours, just chatting, studying, grabbing food, and generally just being around people. It's such a central hub, and I love that. Even managed to hit the gym on Tuesday evening, which felt good to get some energy out.\n\nThe biggest challenge, hands down, has been sleep. Or the lack thereof! Seriously, I think I'm running on fumes from Monday night into Tuesday. All those deadlines really piled up, and I just kept pushing through. It's a bit of a double-edged sword because I feel accomplished, but also know I can't keep that up every week. My stamina is still pretty good, but I can feel the effects of not getting enough rest.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is to prioritize sleep. I need to figure out a better way to manage my time so I'm not pulling those late-nighters quite so often, especially with more deadlines coming up. I want to keep up with my classes, of course, and definitely keep enjoying all the social stuff.

Bringing together academic organization, peer-to-peer support, resource exchange, and event aggregation into one \"peer-powered\" hub is a compelling vision. The \"Lost & Found\" sub-section with the potential for image-based searching is a particularly innovative and practical touch that stands out.\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    Absolutely. Your problem statement is spot-on. The scattering of information, the difficulty in connecting with peers for academic or social purposes, and the general overwhelm of university life are very real and common challenges. Your proposed solution directly addresses these needs, aiming to make campus life more connected and manageable.\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    This is where the ambition of your vision needs careful consideration. You've outlined a comprehensive set of features, each requiring significant development (UI/UX, database management, real-time communication, camera/image handling, notifications, potentially API integrations). While you wisely state that you'd \"focus on building out the core functionalities of the dashboard, study group finder, and a basic resource exchange,\" even the \"core\" of these features, combined with the breadth of the overall concept, is a substantial undertaking for a single semester. The \"image recognition\" for Lost & Found, if it implies advanced AI/ML capabilities, would be a significant technical hurdle for a student team within this timeframe. If it means simply uploading and displaying images for manual identification, it's more feasible. You'll need to be very disciplined in scoping down to a truly minimal viable product (MVP) to ensure successful completion.\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    As noted above, the full vision is quite ambitious. However, your self-awareness in stating you'd focus on core functionalities is crucial. This brings the scope down from \"overly ambitious\" to \"highly ambitious but potentially manageable with strict prioritization.\" It's certainly not too simple; even the MVP will demonstrate a wide range of programming concepts. The challenge will be resisting feature creep and delivering a polished core experience rather than a sprawling, unfinished one.\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    Yes, very much so. You clearly articulate the user's pain points and how your solution would alleviate them, fostering connection, streamlining organization, and making university life more enjoyable. The emphasis on a \"clean, intuitive home screen\" and \"fostering a stronger sense of community\" shows a strong user-centric approach.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\nThis is an excellent project idea with a clear purpose and strong potential for real-world impact. Your understanding of the problem and the proposed solution's benefits is commendable. The primary challenge will be managing the scope to ensure technical feasibility within the semester's constraints. Your stated intention to focus on core functionalities is a good sign of self-awareness, but you'll need to be very disciplined in defining what those \"core\" features truly are.\n\n**25/30**"}, "weekly_desc": "Wow, what a week.
