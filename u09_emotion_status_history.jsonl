I definitely got a lot of sleep, which is great, and my stamina feels pretty good, but looking back, I realize I really let some things slide.\n\nAcademically, it wasn't my strongest week. I noticed the system didn't even record any class experience, and yeah, that's pretty accurate. My COSC 065 classes? I just\u2026 didn't make it. I was in my dorm, Parker House, during those times, and I just couldn't seem to get myself out the door. It\u2019s a bit frustrating because I know I *should* be there, and I usually try to be on top of things, but this week it just didn't happen. I guess my conscientiousness took a bit of a hit.\n\nDespite missing classes, I wasn't completely idle. I spent a good chunk of time in Parker House, just chilling, which was nice for recharging. I did get out to the Alumni Gym on Wednesday night, which felt good to get some physical activity in. On Thursday, I found myself at the Life Sciences Center again. I'm not sure what it is about that building, but I seem to gravitate towards it, even if it's not for a specific class. Maybe it's just the atmosphere, or I was exploring. I also made it to the dining hall, Class of 1953 Commons, a couple of times for late meals, which is always a good way to refuel.\n\nFriday was interesting. I ended up at the Admissions Office in the evening. I'm not entirely sure why I was there, but it felt like a good place to be, maybe just helping out or seeing what was going on. I also spent a lot of time around the Boathouse this week, just enjoying the view or maybe thinking. And on Monday, I popped into the Hopkins Center for the Arts. I like seeing what's happening there; it's always something new and interesting.\n\nSocially, things felt pretty average. I wasn't out and about with huge groups, but I had my moments. I'm generally happy to go with the flow and be around people, but I also appreciate my own space, which I definitely got a lot of this week.\n\nThe big challenge now is looking at the week ahead. I have a bunch of deadlines piling up \u2013 multiple things due Monday, then Tuesday, and Wednesday. Missing those COSC classes means I'm probably a bit behind, and I need to catch up fast. It's a little daunting, but I'm not panicking. I know I can get through it.\n\nMy main goal for next week is to get back into a proper routine. I need to make sure I'm actually *attending* my COSC 065 classes. That's priority number one. And then, it's all about tackling those deadlines head-on. I also want to try and balance my time better, so I'm not just holed up in my dorm, but also making sure I'm on top of my academic responsibilities.

I don't know how that happened, one minute I'm in Parker House, the next it's past class time. It's not ideal, especially with all those deadlines popping up for next week. I did spend some time at the Life Sciences Center on Wednesday and again on Monday, which was good for getting some work done, even if it wasn't for a specific class. I guess I'm trying to keep up with general knowledge, but the specific course material is definitely lagging.\n\nOutside of classes, I\u2019ve been pretty active. I spent a good amount of time at the Boathouse \u2013 it\u2019s such a peaceful spot, even if I was there super early on Saturday morning. I also hit up Leverone Field House for a workout, which felt great. I even made it to the Hopkins Center for the Arts twice, which was a nice change of pace. I'm always up for checking out new things or just enjoying the campus vibe.\n\nSocially, it feels like I\u2019m doing okay. I had some meals at the Commons, and I ventured off campus a couple of times, like to Glen Road Plaza and the Mink Brook Nature Reserve. It\u2019s nice to get a change of scenery and just explore. I\u2019m not always out and about, and I definitely appreciate my downtime in the dorm, but when I do go out, I really enjoy it.

My COSC 065 class is supposed to meet a few times a week, but the system says \"no class experience recorded,\" and looking at my own movements, I was mostly in my dorm during those times. It's a bit of a weird start to the semester, I guess. Maybe it's just the introductory phase, or I'm still figuring out the rhythm. I did make it to Sudikoff Hall late one night, which felt productive, so I know I'm thinking about the computer science stuff. It's just not been in the traditional classroom setting yet.\n\nInstead of classes, a lot of my time was spent at the Admissions Office. I was there quite a bit, which was actually really nice.

Whether it was early morning or later in the day, being by the water and getting some activity in always clears my head. It\u2019s a great way to stay active and just feel good.

My main goal for next week is to really dive into the COSC 065 material, whether that means attending the actual lectures or making sure I'm catching up on everything independently. I need to make sure I'm prepared for those assignments. I also want to keep up with the boathouse and helping at Admissions, because those activities really contribute to feeling good and balanced.

The system says \"No class experience recorded this week,\" and honestly, it's not wrong. I completely missed COSC 065 every single day it was scheduled. I was just\u2026 in my dorm, or somewhere else. I don't know what happened. It's not like I was feeling bad or anything, I just didn't make it. I did spend some time in the library and at Fairchild, so I was *trying* to do some academic stuff, but it wasn't for COSC 065. I also ended up at the Admissions Office a couple of times, which was a bit weird, not sure what that was all about. Maybe I was just wandering?\n\nOutside of classes, I did get out a bit. I had a really nice time at Mink Brook Nature Reserve on Wednesday evening, just getting some fresh air. And then there was that random trip to Lebanon on Wednesday night, which was\u2026 unexpected. I'm still not entirely sure what I was doing there, but it was a change of scenery. My social meter is at 50, which feels pretty accurate. I wasn't out doing huge group things, but I had some good chill time in my dorm, and whatever was happening on Saturday and Sunday in the \"unknown\" locations felt pretty engaging, even if I can't quite recall the specifics right now.\n\nThe biggest challenge, obviously, is the missed classes. My knowledge gain for the week feels pretty low, and that's definitely a direct result of not being in COSC. It's a bit concerning, especially with all these deadlines piling up for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I'm not feeling super stressed about it yet, which is kind of my personality, but I know I *should* be.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is to actually *go* to COSC 065. Seriously.

That walk at Mink Brook was so refreshing, and the Boathouse has become a real go-to spot for just chilling out. Caught a show at the Hop too, which was cool \u2013 always good to experience something new. Had some fun late nights, like that candy run on Friday morning (don't ask!) and hanging out at the Inn.

I had some nice meals at the Class of 1953 Commons, and that dinner at the Hanover Inn was a fun change of pace. There were a few late nights in Parker House, just hanging out with people, which is always a good time. I also enjoyed some quiet moments, like those times near Mink Brook Nature Reserve \u2013 it\u2019s nice to have a place to just breathe and enjoy the outdoors.\n\nAcademically, it was a bit of a strange week, but in a good way. It seems like the official class grind hasn't quite kicked in yet, which is fine by me! I noticed COSC 065 was on the schedule, but I haven't really been in a formal class setting this week. I guess that explains why my \"knowledge\" stats are still pretty low, haha. I did pop into the Admissions Office for something on Wednesday, and I was at Reed Hall on Monday evening for an activity \u2013 maybe a club meeting or something, it was good to be in a classroom setting even if it wasn't a lecture.

I know, I know. It's a bit of a pattern, and the system even says \"no class experience recorded,\" which is pretty accurate. It's not that I don't *want* to learn, but sometimes it feels like there's so much else going on, or I just get caught up in other things. My knowledge stats are definitely showing it, which is a little concerning, especially for COSC.\n\nBut I did get out and about!

I also hit the gym, which felt good, and spent some time down at the Boathouse \u2013 it's such a nice spot to just chill. I even popped into the Guarini Institute on Saturday, just exploring a bit, which was pretty cool.

A bunch of stuff due Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It's definitely time to shift gears. I can't keep skipping classes, especially with COSC 065 having so many sessions.\n\nMy goal for next week is absolutely to get to all my COSC 065 classes. I need to start building up that knowledge base, because right now it's pretty low. And I really need to tackle those deadlines head-on.

Honestly, I feel pretty great. My sleep has been amazing, and I've had so much energy, which is always a plus. I also feel really connected with people, which makes everything better.\n\nAcademically, it was a bit of a mixed bag. I noticed I missed a couple of my COSC 065 classes this week, which wasn't ideal. I think I was just really focused on getting some of the lab work done. I spent a *lot* of time in Sudikoff, especially those late nights on Tuesday. It felt like I was practically living there for a bit! Even though the system didn't log me as \"active\" for all those hours, I was definitely in the zone, trying to wrap my head around some of the concepts. There's so much to learn, and sometimes it feels like I'm just scratching the surface, especially with some of the trickier COSC stuff. But I'm trying my best to keep up, especially with all those deadlines popping up next week. It's a bit daunting to see so many things due on Monday and Tuesday, but I'm trying not to let it get to me too much.\n\nOutside of classes, I actually had a really nice week exploring campus. I popped into the Hood Museum, which was really cool, and spent some time by the Boathouse. I even managed to get out to Mink Brook Nature Reserve for a bit \u2013 it was so peaceful out there. And the Hopkins Center for the Arts always has something interesting going on. I really enjoy just wandering around and seeing what's happening. It's nice to balance the intense study sessions with some time to just breathe and appreciate the surroundings. I also had a couple of good chill sessions back in Parker House, which was much needed.\n\nMy main challenge this week was probably just balancing everything. I want to make sure I'm not falling behind in COSC, but I also really value getting out and experiencing things, and just generally feeling good.\n\nFor next week, my goal is definitely to be more consistent with attending COSC 065 lectures. I think being there in person will help solidify some of those concepts I've been wrestling with in the lab. And of course, tackling those deadlines head-on. I want to get a good start on them early in the week so I'm not pulling another all-nighter. But I also want to make sure I keep up with my social connections and continue to explore. It's all about finding that sweet spot, right?", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: The student explicitly states, \"I've had so much energy,\" indicating a high level of physical and mental vigor. However, the mention of \"spent a *lot* of time in Sudikoff, especially those late nights\" and the challenge of \"balancing everything\" suggest that this energy is being heavily utilized and managed, preventing a perfect score.\n- **Knowledge**: The student notes, \"Academically, it was a bit of a mixed bag,\" and expresses feeling like \"I'm just scratching the surface, especially with some of the trickier COSC stuff.\" They also mention \"wrestling with in the lab\" and needing to \"solidify some of those concepts,\" indicating a perceived gap in understanding despite effort.\n- **Stress**: The student acknowledges that \"It's a bit daunting to see so many things due on Monday and Tuesday,\" which points to a source of stress.

{"week": 10, "emotion": {"stamina": 90, "knowledge": 45, "stress": 15, "happy": 95, "sleep": 98, "social": 90}, "lab_assessment": {"score": 0, "max_score": 0, "topic": "No exam this week", "correct_answers": 0, "total_questions": 0, "week": 10}, "project": {"score": 28.0, "full_text_response": "This is a very well-articulated and thoughtful project idea, Student. You've clearly put a lot of consideration into identifying a genuine problem and proposing a practical, multi-faceted solution. Your breakdown of features and the underlying programming concepts demonstrates a strong understanding of what's achievable within the scope of this course.\n\nHere's my evaluation based on the criteria:\n\n*   **Is the idea innovative or unique compared to existing apps?**\n    While the individual features (course management, deadline tracking, grade calculation, reminders) exist in various forms across many productivity and student organizer apps, your emphasis on a \"syllabus-driven\" central hub and the integration of these specific academic needs into one cohesive application gives \"CourseFlow\" a tailored and focused approach. It's not revolutionary, but it's a very well-defined and practical application of existing concepts to a specific user pain point, which can be considered a form of innovation in user experience and integration.\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    Absolutely. The \"scattered nature of course information\" and the challenge of managing multiple deadlines, readings, and grades across different courses is a universal and significant problem for university students. Your app directly tackles this, aiming to reduce stress and improve organization. This is a highly relevant and impactful problem to solve.\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    Yes, highly feasible. You've wisely chosen core mobile development concepts (UI, local data persistence, notifications, date handling, inter-app communication) that are fundamental and typically covered in a semester-long course. You've also explicitly avoided complex external dependencies like backend servers or advanced AI, which keeps the scope manageable and achievable for a student team.\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    The scope is excellent. It's robust enough to demonstrate a wide range of programming concepts and deliver significant utility, yet it's carefully contained to avoid becoming overwhelming. The features are well-defined, and your clarification that \"smart syllabus integration\" involves manual input (rather than complex parsing) is a good example of managing ambition. This project offers a substantial learning experience without risking incompleteness.\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    Yes, very much so. You've clearly articulated the user problem and the direct benefits (organization, stress reduction, academic performance). Features like a \"dynamic dashboard,\" \"clear, chronological list,\" \"visual cues for urgency,\" and \"customizable reminders\" all point to a user-centric design philosophy. Your personal connection to the problem as a student further reinforces this understanding of user needs.\n\n---\n\n**28/30**"}, "weekly_desc": "Okay, another week wrapped up. It feels like things are moving pretty fast, but I'm actually feeling really good about everything overall. My sleep has been amazing, which definitely helps keep my energy up, and I've been feeling super happy and social.\n\nThis week was a bit... interesting, class-wise. I noticed I didn't make it to any of my COSC 065 sessions. I mean, I was in Sudikoff for a good chunk of Wednesday morning, just kind of getting into the zone, but then I ended up back at Parker House when class was supposed to start. And Thursday and Friday, I just didn't make it out of the dorm for that class either. It's not ideal, I know. I think I just got a bit sidetracked with other things, and honestly, I'm feeling pretty relaxed about it, which is probably a good thing, but I do need to make sure I catch up on what I missed. My general knowledge feels okay, but there's definitely a specific area in COSC that feels a bit fuzzy right now, probably because I haven't been in class.\n\nWednesday afternoon was pretty cool, though. I had some kind of activity at McNutt Hall around noon \u2013 probably just sorting out some admin stuff, nothing too exciting. But then later, I spent a good chunk of the evening at the Boathouse. That was really fun, definitely got some good activity in there. It's always nice to get out and do something active, and it really helps clear my head.\n\nLooking ahead, I've got quite a few deadlines piling up for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It's a bit of a stack, but I'm not feeling overwhelmed by it. I just need to sit down and map out a plan to tackle them. My main goal for next week is definitely to get back on track with COSC 065. I need to review the material I missed and make sure I'm ready for whatever's coming. And, of course, just keep up with these deadlines without letting them stress me out too much.
