It\u2019s hard to even pinpoint what happened, or rather, what *didn't* happen. The biggest thing, and it\u2019s really weighing on me, is that I didn't make it to a single one of my scheduled classes. Not COSC 050, not COSC 065, and not even FILM 051, which I usually enjoy.\n\nI know I should have been there. Every morning, I\u2019d wake up, and the thought of going would just feel\u2026 heavy. My schedule says I was in Goldstein Hall for most of those class times, just kind of existing. It\u2019s frustrating because I *want* to be on top of things. My conscientiousness is screaming at me about all the material I\u2019ve missed, and the deadlines are just piling up. Seriously, looking at that list of deadlines, especially all those Tuesdays and Thursdays, makes my stomach churn. It feels like a mountain I haven't even started climbing.\n\nI did manage to get out of the dorm sometimes, though. I spent a lot of time at the Boathouse, which is usually a good escape. I don't know if I was actually doing anything productive there, but it felt like a place I could just be. There were a few times I had \"activity\" there, so maybe I was just trying to clear my head.\n\nThe Hanover Inn was a weird one. I found myself there for long stretches, especially Thursday through Saturday. I\u2019m not sure why, it just felt like a quiet place to be, away from everything. I tried to focus, I think, but it was mostly just... being. Friday night, there was some activity there, which was a brief moment of something different, but it\u2019s all a bit hazy.\n\nI did make it to the Black Family Visual Arts Center a few times, which is where FILM 051 is. Even though I missed the lectures, I think I was trying to work on some project stuff there. It felt good to actually *do* something, even if it wasn't attending class. And I went to the Hopkins Center for the Arts on Saturday, which was a nice break, a moment of actual engagement with something creative. I even hit the gym on Monday night, which felt like a small victory, at least I got some physical activity in.\n\nBut then there was that moment on Saturday night, where I was at an \"Unknown\" location and had \"activity.\" I honestly don't even remember what that was about. It just feels like a blur, another sign that my head wasn't really in the game this week.\n\nThe constant feeling of being overwhelmed, coupled with the guilt of not attending classes, has been really draining. My sleep and stamina are somehow still high, which is confusing, because mentally, I feel exhausted. My happiness and social levels are just\u2026 average, which feels about right. I haven't really been seeking out social interactions, preferring to just retreat.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to turn this around. My main goal is simple: attend every single one of my classes. No excuses. I need to start catching up on the material I missed, especially for COSC, because those deadlines are not going to wait. I also need to break down those looming assignments into smaller, manageable chunks so they don't feel so impossible. I just need to get back on track, one step at a time.

COSC 050, COSC 065, FILM 051 \u2013 I just\u2026 didn't make it. Every morning, I\u2019d wake up, and the thought of getting out of Goldstein Hall and facing the day, especially with how low my stamina feels, was just too much. It\u2019s frustrating because I *want* to be there, I really do. My general knowledge feels pretty solid, but when it comes to the specific stuff for these classes, I feel like I'm falling so far behind. It\u2019s like my brain just shuts down when it comes to the actual coursework.\n\nMy energy levels are just shot. Even though I'm getting a decent amount of sleep, I wake up feeling completely drained. It makes everything feel like a monumental effort. I spent a lot of time at the Boathouse this week. It\u2019s peaceful there, just watching the water. It\u2019s a good escape when my head feels too full. I also found myself at the VAC a few times, just wandering around. There\u2019s something about being in a creative space that\u2019s calming, even if I wasn\u2019t actively doing anything. That one night at the Hanover Inn was\u2026 unexpected. I just needed a complete change of scenery, I guess. And the trip out to Lebanon, that was definitely a spur-of-the-moment thing, just to get off campus for a bit.\n\nThe looming deadlines are really starting to get to me. There are so many due on Tuesday, and then more on Thursday and Sunday. It\u2019s a constant knot in my stomach. I feel this immense pressure, and it just makes me want to retreat even more. I know I need to be more disciplined, but the anxiety of it all just paralyzes me sometimes.\n\nSo, for next week, I really need to turn things around. My main goal is to actually *attend* my classes. No more hiding in my dorm. I need to break down these assignments into smaller, manageable chunks so they don't feel so overwhelming. Maybe I can try to get to the library or a different study spot instead of just staying in my room. And I need to figure out a way to boost my stamina, or at least manage it better, so I don't feel so utterly exhausted all the time.

My stamina is just completely shot.\n\nI know I missed all my classes again. Every single one. COSC 050, COSC 065, FILM 051... I just couldn't bring myself to go.

So many things due on Tuesday, and then more on Thursday, and Monday again. It's a constant hum of dread in the back of my mind. I try to plan, I really do, but then the actual execution just falls apart.\n\nI spent a lot of time at the Boathouse this week. It's become my default escape, I guess. Just sitting there, watching the water, trying to clear my head. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it just makes me feel more isolated. I was there late at night a few times, just needing to get out of the dorm, needing to be somewhere quiet where I didn't feel the pressure of all the work waiting for me. I even ended up at the Hanover Inn one night, which was\u2026 strange. I don't even really remember why, just that I needed to be somewhere else.\n\nMy social life is basically non-existent right now. My social score is so low, and it feels accurate. I haven't really connected with anyone. It's hard to reach out when you feel this drained and just generally *off*. I know I should, but the thought of putting on a brave face and pretending everything's fine is just too much effort. I did go to the Admissions Office a couple of times, which was random, and spent some time at the Visual Arts Center, but mostly just wandering, not really engaging.\n\nI feel like I'm stuck in this cycle of feeling bad, which makes me avoid things, which then makes me feel worse. My happiness is so low, and I can feel it. It's a constant weight.\n\nFor next week, I really, *really* need to try and break this cycle. My main goal has to be to attend at least one class. Just one. Even if I just sit in the back and don't say anything. I need to prove to myself that I can still do it. And I need to start chipping away at these deadlines, even if it's just for an hour a day. I can't let them completely overwhelm me. Maybe I'll try to find a new spot to study, somewhere that isn't my dorm or the Boathouse, just for a change of scenery.

I need to set a hard stop time for working, even if I feel like I haven't done enough.\n4.  **Find a way to be productive in Sudikoff.** If I'm going to spend hours there, I need to make those hours count.

It feels like I just blinked and it\u2019s over, but also like it dragged on forever. Honestly, I\u2019m just so tired. My head feels fuzzy from the lack of sleep, and I can barely remember what day it is sometimes. Waking up at 3 AM or 4 AM has become the norm, and it\u2019s just not sustainable. I feel like I\u2019m constantly running on fumes, and my stamina is just\u2026 gone.\n\nI know I have classes, I really do. COSC 050, COSC 065, FILM 051 \u2013 they\u2019re all on my schedule. But actually *getting* to them this week felt impossible. Every morning, I\u2019d wake up feeling so drained, and the thought of sitting through a lecture just felt overwhelming. I ended up staying in my dorm, Goldstein Hall, way too much. It\u2019s frustrating because I *want* to be there, I want to learn, but the energy just isn't there. It\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this cycle of feeling behind, which makes me anxious, which makes me tired, which makes me miss more.\n\nMost of my \"activity\" this week was late-night, holed up in Sudikoff. Especially Monday night and Tuesday night. There are so many deadlines piling up, it\u2019s insane. I was trying to catch up on COSC work, just grinding away until the early hours. It feels like I\u2019m constantly playing catch-up, and even though I\u2019m putting in the hours, I still feel like I\u2019m barely treading water. All those deadlines for Tuesday, and then more for Thursday and Sunday\u2026 it\u2019s just a lot to juggle. My knowledge is still high, I think, because I *am* trying to teach myself everything I miss, but it\u2019s such an inefficient and exhausting way to learn.\n\nSocially, I\u2019m pretty much a ghost. My social meter is at a 5, and honestly, that feels generous. I barely saw anyone this week, just a few fleeting moments. It\u2019s hard to reach out when you feel this burnt out and just want to crawl into bed. I did manage to get out a few times \u2013 a quick trip to the library, the Hood Museum, even the Boathouse \u2013 but they felt more like desperate attempts to escape the dorm than actual enjoyable outings. Even those brief moments didn't really lift my spirits. My happiness is so low, and I just feel this constant hum of anxiety.\n\nThe biggest challenge right now is definitely the burnout. I\u2019m exhausted, stressed, and feeling incredibly isolated. I know I need to get my sleep schedule back on track, but the fear of falling further behind keeps me up. And then missing classes just makes the anxiety worse. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear, even if they feel daunting.\n1.  **Prioritize sleep:** I *have* to get more than a few hours. Even if it means sacrificing a bit of study time, I need to be functional.\n2.  **Attend at least one class, maybe two:** Just getting myself there would be a huge win.

It\u2019s hard to even pinpoint where the days went, and looking back, it\u2019s a bit disheartening.\n\nThe biggest thing I need to reflect on is that I didn't make it to any of my classes. Not a single one. I know it sounds bad, and it *is* bad. My COSC classes, FILM\u2026 I just couldn't bring myself to go. I spent so much time in Sudikoff, especially late at night and over the weekend, just trying to keep up with the assignments. It feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and the thought of sitting in a lecture just felt overwhelming when I knew I had so much coding or reading to do. I feel this constant hum of anxiety about falling behind, even though I'm trying to teach myself the material. My knowledge levels are still high, which is a small comfort, but it doesn't excuse missing everything.\n\nOutside of the academic grind, my energy levels have been so low. I spent a lot of time in my dorm, Goldstein Hall, just trying to recharge, but it never really felt like enough. There were a few moments where I got out \u2013 I was at the Admissions Office twice, which was a bit random, and I found myself at the Boathouse a few times, mostly in the very early morning hours. I guess those were attempts to break the monotony or just get some air. I even ended up at the Hopkins Center for the Arts for a bit on Thursday, which was a nice change of scenery, but I didn't really *do* anything there. It felt more like wandering.\n\nSocially, it\u2019s been pretty quiet. My social meter is definitely low, and honestly, I haven't really had the drive to change that. When I'm feeling this drained and stressed, the thought of engaging with people just feels like another task. I know it's not ideal, but it's where I'm at right now.\n\nThe sheer number of deadlines looming is just\u2026 a lot. There are so many due on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday. It\u2019s like a constant pressure cooker, and it\u2019s definitely contributing to how I\u2019m feeling. My happiness is pretty low, and I can feel the stress building. It\u2019s a weird paradox \u2013 I\u2019m getting a lot of sleep, which is good, but I still feel so tired and overwhelmed.\n\nFor next week, my absolute top priority is getting to class. No excuses. I need to break this cycle of missing lectures and then trying to compensate by working myself into the ground. I also need to be more strategic about tackling these deadlines. Maybe breaking them down into smaller, more manageable chunks will help. And I really need to find a way to boost my stamina, even if it's just forcing myself to take a proper walk outside every day. I need to get back on track, not just with my academics, but with my overall well-being.

I'm sitting here trying to piece it all together, and it's just a jumble of anxiety and late nights. My happiness is practically non-existent, and my social battery is completely drained, which isn't surprising since I barely saw anyone. My stamina feels shot, too, even though I've been getting a decent amount of sleep, which is weird. It's like my brain is just tired of being stressed.\n\nThe biggest thing, and it's hard to even write this, is that I didn't make it to a single class. Not one. COSC 050, COSC 065, FILM 051 \u2013 I missed them all. Every time a class was supposed to start, I was either still in my dorm, or somewhere else entirely, just... not there. I feel this immense wave of guilt and dread about it. I know I *should* be there, I know it's important, and it's not like I don't care about the material \u2013 my knowledge scores are still pretty high, so I'm trying to keep up on my own, but it's just not the same. It's like there's this invisible wall keeping me from getting out the door and into the classroom.\n\nWednesday was a bit of a whirlwind. I was active in Reed Hall and the library, then Sudikoff, then the Boathouse, then back to Sudikoff late at night. It felt like I was constantly moving, but not necessarily productively. Thursday and Friday were mostly spent in my dorm, Goldstein Hall, just... existing. I did manage to get to Fairchild on Friday afternoon and The Lodge late Thursday and Friday nights, but it felt more like I was just drifting. The pattern of being inactive during the day, especially during class times, and then having bursts of activity late at night, often in Sudikoff, is really concerning. It's like I'm trying to catch up on work when everyone else is asleep, but it just makes me feel more isolated.\n\nThe sheer number of deadlines looming over me is probably a huge part of this. There are so many due on Tuesday and Thursday, and a few on Sunday and Monday too. It feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and it's just overwhelming. I spend hours in Sudikoff trying to chip away at things, but it feels like I'm barely making a dent.\n\nMy biggest challenge this week was definitely the lack of attendance and the resulting anxiety. It's a vicious cycle: I feel anxious, so I don't go to class, which makes me more anxious about falling behind, and then I just retreat further. I also feel incredibly isolated. My social score is so low, and it's true \u2013 I haven't really connected with anyone.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear, even if they feel daunting.\n1.  **Get to class.** Seriously, I need to break this cycle. Even if I just show up for part of it, I need to be there. I'll try to set multiple alarms and maybe even ask a friend to drag me out of bed.\n2.  **Tackle those deadlines proactively.** I need to stop waiting until the last minute and spreading myself thin. I'll try to break down the bigger assignments into smaller, manageable chunks.\n3.  **Force myself to be more social.** Even if it's just grabbing coffee with someone or joining a study group. I know I'm not super extraverted, but this level of isolation isn't healthy.\n4.  **Figure out why my stamina is so low.** Maybe it's mental exhaustion, but I need to find a way to recharge that isn't just sleeping.\n\nThis week was rough, but I have to believe I can turn it around.

Honestly, it feels like a blur, mostly just a cycle of Sudikoff and my dorm room. My happiness is still in the gutter, and my social battery is completely drained, which isn't surprising given how little I've actually interacted with anyone. Stamina's also super low, which makes sense when I think about it.\n\nAcademically, it's a weird mix. My knowledge levels are still pretty high, which I guess is a testament to how much time I'm pouring into studying, especially for COSC. Sudikoff has basically become my second home. I was there for hours on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, often late into the night. It feels like I'm constantly working on something, probably trying to get ahead or just keep up with the sheer volume of material.\n\nThe big thing, though, is that I didn't make it to any of my classes this week. Not COSC 050, not COSC 065, and definitely not FILM 051. I was in my dorm during most of those times, or already holed up in Sudikoff. It's frustrating because I know I *should* be there, but the pull of getting work done, especially with all these deadlines looming, just takes over. There are so many due dates coming up \u2013 multiple things for Tuesday, Thursday, and Monday. It's a constant weight on my mind, and I just get so absorbed in trying to tackle them that everything else falls by the wayside.\n\nI did have a few moments where I was out and about \u2013 a quick trip to the Boathouse, and then that strange detour to the Admissions Office and McNutt Hall on Thursday night. I'm not even sure why I was there, just wandering I guess. And I was at the Visual Arts Center on Thursday and Tuesday, but again, not for class. It's like I'm physically moving around, but my mind is still stuck on the next problem set or reading.\n\nThis intense focus on CS, while good for my grades, is clearly taking a toll. My sleep is surprisingly okay, but I'm just so *tired* of feeling this way. The constant pressure, the isolation... it's a lot. I know I'm not the most social person to begin with, but this is getting ridiculous.\n\nFor next week, I really need to try and break this cycle. My main goal has to be *attending classes*. Even if I feel like I can learn the material on my own, the structure and the change of pace would probably do me some good. Especially FILM 051 \u2013 I picked it because I wanted something different, and I'm just letting it slip. I also need to figure out a way to manage these deadlines without sacrificing my entire life to Sudikoff. Maybe setting stricter hours for myself, or actually taking a proper break.

I was at the Boathouse super late Friday night, just trying to clear my head, I guess. Or maybe just avoiding going back to the dorm.
