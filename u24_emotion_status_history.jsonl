M&SS 045, those early mornings at Kemeny are always a struggle, especially when I'm running on fumes. I try to keep up, but sometimes it feels like I'm just absorbing words without them really sticking. COSC 060 in the afternoons at LSB usually picks up a bit. I actually found myself getting into some of the concepts this week, which was cool. There's always something new to dig into, even if it feels like a lot to absorb.

I love hanging with people, and I\u2019ve definitely been doing a lot of that. It\u2019s great to connect, and I wouldn\u2019t trade those moments for anything, but I think I might have overdone it. It\u2019s like my social battery is always on full, but everything else is running on empty.\n\nLooking back, it\u2019s almost like I wasn\u2019t even *in* class this week. I know I have M&SS 045 at Kemeny, and COSC 060 and 065 at LSB, but my memory of actually sitting in those lecture halls is super hazy. Did I miss stuff? I feel like I should be more worried about that, but my brain just can\u2019t quite latch onto the anxiety right now. It\u2019s a strange feeling, like I\u2019m floating above my own schedule. I mean, I *think* I get the material, especially the COSC stuff, but if I wasn't actually there, how much am I really absorbing? It's a bit unsettling.\n\nAnd then I look at the upcoming deadlines, and it\u2019s like a punch to the gut. So many things due on Monday, then Wednesday, and a couple on Tuesday too. How am I supposed to tackle all that when I can barely keep my eyes open? It\u2019s a lot, and the thought of it just makes me want to pull the covers over my head and disappear. This is where the stress really kicks in, because I know I *should* be on top of it, but the energy just isn't there.\n\nMy biggest challenge this week was definitely just staying afloat. Balancing the need to be social, which genuinely makes me feel good in the moment, with the absolute exhaustion that follows. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. I feel like I\u2019m constantly choosing between being a hermit and being completely burnt out.\n\nNext week *has* to be different. Seriously. My number one goal is to get some actual, proper sleep. Like, real sleep, not just a few hours here and there. I need to reset my body and my mind. I also need to make sure I\u2019m actually *in* my classes. No more just vaguely remembering them. I need to be present, take notes, and engage. And then, I need to start chipping away at these assignments. I can\u2019t let them pile up any more than they already have. Maybe I need to be a bit more disciplined about my evenings, even if it means saying no to a few social things. It\u2019s hard, because I love being around people, but I can\u2019t keep sacrificing my well-being for it. I need to find a way to feel happy and energized again, not just perpetually tired and stressed. A solid routine, that\u2019s what I need.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina:** The student explicitly states, \"My stamina is basically non-existent,\" and describes feeling \"incredibly tired,\" \"brain is just\u2026 fried,\" and \"can barely keep my eyes open,\" indicating extreme exhaustion and very low physical and mental energy.\n-   **Knowledge:** The student's memory of classes is \"super hazy,\" and they question, \"if I wasn't actually there, how much am I really absorbing? It's a bit unsettling.\" While they \"think I get the material, especially the COSC stuff,\" the overall uncertainty and lack of presence suggest a significant dip in confidence and actual absorption.\n-   **Stress:** The student describes looking at deadlines as \"a punch to the gut\" and states, \"This is where the stress really kicks in,\" feeling overwhelmed by \"so many things due\" and the inability to cope due to lack of energy.\n-   **Happy:** The student reports feeling \"just\u2026 low\" and that their lack of stamina is \"dragging down my mood.\" They express a need to \"find a way to feel happy and energized again,\" indicating a very low current state of happiness despite enjoying social interactions in the moment.\n-   **Sleep:** The student states, \"I haven\u2019t had a decent night\u2019s sleep in ages\" and that their \"number one goal is to get some actual, proper sleep, not just a few hours here and there,\" clearly indicating severe sleep deprivation.\n-   **Social:** The student expresses, \"I love hanging with people, and I\u2019ve definitely been doing a lot of that.

Seriously, I feel like I've been running on fumes since Monday morning, and honestly, I'm not sure I ever really stopped. My body feels completely drained, and my brain is just a fuzzy mess. I'm pretty sure I've been surviving on caffeine and sheer willpower, which, spoiler alert, isn't a sustainable strategy.\n\nLooking back, it's almost funny how little I remember actually *being* in class. M&SS 045, COSC 060, COSC 065 \u2013 they all just blur into a distant memory of \"I should have been there.\" It's not that I didn't *want* to go, it's just that every waking moment felt consumed by the sheer mountain of deadlines. Seriously, what was with all those assignments due on Monday? And then more on Tuesday and Wednesday? It felt like the universe conspired to drop every single project at once. I was just trying to keep my head above water, frantically typing away, trying to absorb enough information to get *something* submitted. My knowledge score feels like it's both sky-high from cramming and rock-bottom from forgetting it all the second I hit submit.\n\nDespite feeling like a zombie, my social battery is apparently still fully charged. I guess that's one way to cope, right? Needed those breaks, even if they probably cost me more sleep. It's weird, I feel so physically exhausted, but being around people actually gives me a bit of a boost, even if it's temporary. It's like my brain needs the distraction from the constant stress of \"what's due next?\"\n\nThe biggest challenge, hands down, was the overwhelming feeling of being behind before I even started. The lack of sleep just compounded everything, making it harder to focus, harder to care, and just generally making me feel pretty miserable. My happiness levels are definitely in the gutter right now.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to figure out a better balance. My main goal is to actually *attend* my classes \u2013 M&SS 045, COSC 060, COSC 065 \u2013 and try to absorb the material in real-time instead of playing catch-up later. And honestly, I desperately need to prioritize sleep. Like, actual, proper sleep. I can't keep functioning on 5 hours a night. I need to get ahead of these deadlines, or at least not let them pile up so catastrophically again. Maybe I'll try to break things down into smaller chunks. And hopefully, just hopefully, I can feel a little less stressed and a little more human by the end of it.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: 5 - The student explicitly states feeling \"running on fumes,\" \"completely drained,\" and \"like a zombie,\" indicating extremely low physical and mental energy.\n- **Knowledge**: 20 - While the student mentions \"sky-high from cramming,\" they immediately contradict this by saying \"rock-bottom from forgetting it all the second I hit submit\" and \"how little I remember actually *being* in class,\" suggesting very poor retention and understanding.\n- **Stress**: 95 - The journal is filled with indicators of extreme stress, such as \"sheer mountain of deadlines,\" \"overwhelming feeling of being behind,\" and \"constant stress of 'what's due next?'\"\n- **Happy**: 10 - The student directly states \"making me feel pretty miserable\" and \"My happiness levels are definitely in the gutter right now,\" indicating very low emotional well-being.\n- **Sleep**: 5 - The student mentions \"cost me more sleep,\" \"lack of sleep,\" and specifically \"I can't keep functioning on 5 hours a night,\" highlighting severe sleep deprivation.\n- **Social**: 85 - Despite all other struggles, the student notes \"my social battery is apparently still fully charged\" and that \"being around people actually gives me a bit of a boost,\" suggesting a high capacity and positive experience with social interaction."}

Honestly, it feels like I just blinked and it was Friday again. And not in a good way, more like a \"how did I get here and why am I so tired?\" kind of way. My brain feels like static, and my body just wants to collapse.\n\nClasses this week\u2026 well, that\u2019s a funny one. It says \"no class experience recorded,\" and yeah, that pretty much sums it up. I mean, I *was* there, physically, for most of them. Dragging myself to Kemeny for M&SS 045 at 8:45 AM felt like climbing Mount Everest every single day. My eyes were open, but I swear my brain was still in bed. And the COSC classes in the afternoon at LSB weren't much better. I'd sit there, trying to absorb what was being said, but it was like listening through a thick pane of glass. The information just wasn't sticking. I feel like I missed so much, even when I was technically present. It's frustrating because I *want* to learn, I really do, but the energy just isn't there.\n\nThe biggest challenge, hands down, has been this crushing exhaustion. I'm running on fumes, and it's making everything feel ten times harder. Sleep has been a foreign concept, and my stamina is just\u2026 gone. It\u2019s weird though, because despite feeling like a zombie, I've still been out and about a lot. My social battery is somehow still charged, even if my actual physical battery is at 5%. I guess being around people is a good distraction, or maybe it's just what I naturally gravitate towards. It's probably not helping the sleep situation, but it feels necessary, you know? Like, if I'm going to be this tired, at least I can be tired with my friends.\n\nAnd then there are the deadlines. Oh my god, the deadlines. Looking at that list just makes my stomach clench. So many things due Monday, and then again on Wednesday. It's a constant hum of anxiety in the back of my mind. How am I supposed to tackle all of that when I can barely keep my eyes open? It feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and the gap just keeps getting wider.\n\nSo, goals for next week? First and foremost, sleep. I *have* to prioritize it. I need to figure out a way to get more than five hours a night, even if it means saying no to some social stuff. It's hard, but I know I can't keep going like this. Second, I need to actually *engage* in class. Not just be there, but be *present*. Maybe if I get some sleep, my brain will actually function. And third, I need to get a handle on these deadlines. I'm going to try to break them down into smaller chunks and just chip away at them, even if it's just for an hour or two at a time. It feels overwhelming right now, but I have to believe I can turn this around. I just need to find that spark again.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina:** The student explicitly states \"my stamina is just\u2026 gone\" and \"my actual physical battery is at 5%,\" indicating extreme exhaustion and a very low energy level.
