Again. It's not like I *don't* want to go, it's just... the thought of getting up, getting ready, and actually being *there* feels like climbing a mountain sometimes. Especially with ENGS 069 and 093, they're so early on Friday and Monday. And then 025 right after. I know I should be there, I really do. The deadlines are piling up, and that's definitely making my stomach churn. So many Wed and Mon deadlines, it's just a constant pressure. I see them, I know they're there, and then I just... don't do anything about them. It's a cycle.\n\nI spent a ridiculous amount of time at the Admissions Office this week. Like, *so much* time. I don't even know why. I wasn't really doing anything productive there, just... existing. It's weird. Maybe it's just a quiet place to be, away from my dorm, but not quite in the library. Though I did make it to the library for a bit on Saturday, which was a small win, I guess. And the Hopkins Center! I was there a lot too. I love the vibe there, even if I wasn't actively doing anything specific. Just being around that creative energy is nice. I wonder if there's something I could get involved with there. My mind is always buzzing with ideas, even if my body isn't always following through.\n\nIt's frustrating, honestly. I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of doing something, but then I just... don't. My sleep is fine, my stamina is fine, so it's not a physical thing. It's more like a mental block. All these \"No Activity\" entries in my log are basically my life story this week. Just... present, but not engaged.\n\nI really need to get a grip. The sheer volume of deadlines is overwhelming, and I'm not even sure where to start. I guess for next week, the absolute bare minimum goal is to actually *show up* to at least one class. Just one. Maybe ENGS 093 on Tuesday, since it's the only one that day and I won't have the excuse of back-to-back classes. And I need to pick *one* deadline and just start. Even if it's just opening the assignment. Just one small step. I know I'm capable, I just need to figure out how to bridge the gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it.

I don't even know where to begin. I missed everything. Every single ENGS 025, 069, 093 lecture. It\u2019s like I\u2019d wake up, see the time, and just\u2026 freeze. The thought of going, of facing whatever was waiting, just felt impossible. I know I *should* have been at lsb for ENGS 069 on Thursday and Friday, and then again Monday and Wednesday. And cummings for ENGS 025, and MacLean for 093. But I just couldn't. It\u2019s this weird cycle where the more I miss, the more anxious I get about going, and then I miss more. It\u2019s a mess.\n\nI spent a lot of time in my room, the Admissions Office, just\u2026 existing. It feels like a safe bubble, even if it\u2019s also a bit of a prison. I did manage to drag myself out sometimes. Thursday afternoon, I was near the Life Sciences Center, and then later at the Hopkins Center for the Arts. The Hop is always a good escape. Just being surrounded by creativity, it\u2019s a different kind of energy. I went back there late Thursday night, and again Saturday evening. It\u2019s a nice distraction from the constant hum of deadlines in my head.\n\nFriday afternoon, I was back at the Life Sciences Center, but again, not for class. Just sort of wandering, I guess. And then later that evening, I actually made it to Leverone Field House. That was good, at least I got some movement in. My body feels fine, it\u2019s my head that\u2019s the problem. Monday, I was out in Zahm Courtyard super late, just needed some air, I think. And then later that day, I was at the Life Sciences Center again, and Fairchild Physical Sciences Center in the evening. I guess I gravitate towards academic buildings, even if I'm not actually *in* class. It's like I'm trying to absorb knowledge by osmosis or something.\n\nSocially, it was pretty quiet. My social battery is definitely running low. I didn't really connect with anyone this week. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s just\u2026 hard to initiate when I feel this overwhelmed. I guess that contributes to the low happiness too.\n\nThe biggest challenge, obviously, was just showing up. And the deadlines. Oh my god, the deadlines. There are so many of them, especially for Wednesday and Monday. It\u2019s like a constant pressure cooker, and instead of dealing with it, I just\u2026 deflate. I know I have a lot of knowledge, I feel like I understand the concepts, but the execution, the actual *doing* of the work, feels impossible right now. It\u2019s frustrating because I know I *can* do it, but the motivation just isn't there, or it gets swallowed by the anxiety. At least I'm getting a lot of sleep, which is something, I guess. My stamina is surprisingly high, so physically I'm okay, but mentally I'm just drained.\n\nFor next week, my goal, my absolute non-negotiable goal, is to go to class. Just *go*. Even if I just sit there and absorb a fraction of it. I need to break this cycle. I need to be in those ENGS 069, 093, and 025 lectures. And I need to pick *one* deadline, just one, and actually make significant progress on it. Not all of them, just one. I need to feel like I\u2019m not drowning.

The schedule says I have them, but my internal log says \"no class experience recorded.\" That\u2019s\u2026 accurate. I didn't make it to any of my ENGS classes this week. Not 025, not 069, not 093. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *want* to go, or that I don\u2019t care about the material \u2013 my knowledge is still pretty high, so I guess I\u2019m absorbing things somehow, or maybe I just know a lot already. But actually getting myself there, especially with everything else swirling around, just felt impossible. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this invisible wall. I know I *should* be there, and then the guilt just makes it harder to even think about.\n\nMost of my time seems to have been spent at the Admissions Office, which is weird. I mean, it\u2019s quiet, I guess? A lot of \"no activity\" there, which probably means I was just\u2026 existing. Maybe trying to focus, maybe just staring into space. It\u2019s a strange place to spend so much time, but sometimes you just need to be somewhere that isn't your room, but also isn't too stimulating. I did have some \"activity\" there a few times, like Thursday afternoon and Friday evening, and even super early Wednesday morning. Not sure what I was doing, but at least I was *doing* something, even if it was just being present.\n\nThe Hopkins Center was a bit of a refuge, though. I was there a few times, late on Thursday and again after midnight on Tuesday. It\u2019s nice to just be around that creative energy, even if I\u2019m not actively participating. It\u2019s a good escape from the constant hum of deadlines. And the Boathouse, too \u2013 I was there Wednesday and Monday evening. It\u2019s a good spot to clear my head, just watch the water. It\u2019s not exactly a social hub for me, but it\u2019s a place where I can just *be*.\n\nI also ended up at McNutt Hall twice, which is interesting since my classes are all engineering. I don't really have a reason to be there, but I guess I was just wandering, exploring. Or maybe I was trying to find a different kind of stimulation, something outside my usual academic bubble.\n\nSocially, I\u2019m still pretty low. I mean, 25? That feels about right. I\u2019m not completely isolated, but I\u2019m definitely not seeking out big groups. The Boathouse and Hopkins Center visits were probably more about personal space than connecting with people. It\u2019s hard to be super social when you feel this overwhelmed.\n\nAnd the deadlines. Oh my god, the deadlines. They\u2019re just piling up. So many for Wednesday, then Monday, then Wednesday again, and scattered throughout the rest of the week. It\u2019s like a constant low-level hum of dread in the back of my mind. That\u2019s definitely contributing to the low happiness and probably why my neuroticism is so high. It feels like I\u2019m drowning in things I *should* be doing, but can\u2019t quite bring myself to start. My stamina is surprisingly high, and I\u2019m getting a lot of sleep, which is good, but it feels like my brain is just refusing to cooperate with my body.\n\nChallenges? Definitely the lack of motivation for classes, the sheer volume of upcoming work, and just feeling generally disconnected and anxious. It\u2019s a weird paradox \u2013 I\u2019m getting enough sleep, I have energy, and I know my stuff, but the mental block is just massive.\n\nFor next week, I really need to try and break this cycle. My goals are pretty simple, but feel huge right now:\n1.  **Attend at least one class.** Just one. Any one. Just to prove I can do it.\n2.  **Pick one deadline and actually make significant progress on it.** Not all of them, just one. Maybe the earliest one, or the one that seems least daunting.\n3.  **Find a new quiet spot on campus.** The Admissions Office is getting a bit\u2026 repetitive. Maybe somewhere with more natural light.\n4.  **Try to reach out to someone.** Even just a text.

That's a thing. I know I have ENGS 025, 069, 093. I see them on my schedule, I know where they are. But somehow, the days just\u2026 happen. I didn't make it to any of them this week. Again. It's this weird mix of knowing I *should* be there, feeling a knot in my stomach about not being there, and then just\u2026 not going. It's like there's a wall between me and the lecture hall. The thought of walking in, feeling like I'm already behind, it just makes me want to curl up. My knowledge stats are high, which is ironic, because it's not like I'm actively learning anything new in a structured way. It's more like I'm absorbing things through osmosis, or maybe just remembering what I already knew.\n\nMost of my time felt like it was spent in this weird limbo, mostly around the Admissions Office area. I don't know why, it's just where I ended up. Not really doing anything, just\u2026 existing. It's quiet there, I guess. A lot of \"no activity\" hours, which pretty much sums up how I felt. Just a lot of blank space.\n\nBut then, there were these moments. Like Wednesday night, suddenly I was in Sudikoff Hall. I don't even remember what I was doing, just\u2026 something. And then, out of nowhere, I ended up at the Hood Museum. It was late, almost midnight, but there was something about being there, just wandering through the quiet halls, looking at the art. It felt\u2026 expansive. Like my mind could finally breathe. And the Hopkins Center, too. I found myself there a few times, late at night, just soaking in the atmosphere. There's a certain energy there, even when it's empty, that I find really compelling. It's like my brain craves that kind of input, that kind of beauty, even when the rest of me is just\u2026 stuck.\n\nThursday was a bit of a blur. I remember ending up at Dick's House in the afternoon. Just felt a bit off, you know? Nothing major, just needed to check in. It's hard to shake this general feeling of unease lately. My happiness is pretty low, and I can feel that anxiety buzzing under the surface most of the time.\n\nSocially, it was a pretty quiet week. My social meter is definitely on the low side. I didn't really connect with anyone. It's not that I don't want to, it's just\u2026 the energy isn't there. Or maybe I just don't know how to start. I feel like I'm a ghost sometimes, just moving through campus without really interacting.\n\nThe biggest challenge, honestly, is the sheer number of deadlines looming. It's like a tidal wave. So many things due on Wednesday, then Monday, then Wednesday again. My stomach clenches just thinking about it. I know I need to get on top of them, but the more I think about it, the more paralyzed I feel. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nFor next week, I really, *really* need to break this cycle. My goals are pretty clear, even if executing them feels impossible right now:\n1.  **Go to class.** Just one. Start with one. Maybe ENGS 069 on Monday, since it's earlier. Just show up.\n2.  **Tackle *one* deadline.** Pick the easiest one, or the one that's due soonest, and just get it done. Even if it's not perfect. Just to prove to myself I can.\n3.  **Find a way to feel less\u2026 isolated.** Maybe just grab coffee with someone, anyone. Or even just sit in a common area and try to be present.\n\nI'm sleeping a lot, which is good, I guess. My stamina is high, so it's not a physical exhaustion thing. It's more like a mental block.

I didn't make it to any of them. Not ENGS 025, not 069, not 093. I saw the times on my schedule, I knew where they were supposed to be, but every time, it just felt like too much.

It's a vicious cycle, and honestly, it makes me feel pretty terrible. My happiness score must be in the gutter, and it is.\n\nMost of my time was spent at what the system calls the \"Admissions Office,\" which is basically just my room. I was there a lot. A *lot*.

The art, the atmosphere, it\u2019s a nice escape from the constant hum of anxiety in my head. And I made it to the Boathouse twice. That was good.

ENGS 025, 069, 093\u2026 I saw them on my schedule, I really did. But when the time came, I just couldn't bring myself to go. It\u2019s this weird paralysis. I\u2019d be at the Admissions Office, or sometimes the Hop, just\u2026 existing. I don't know why I spend so much time at the Admissions Office. It's quiet, I guess. Sometimes I think I'll get some work done there, but then hours just melt away. It's not like I'm doing anything productive. Most of the time, I'm just sitting, staring, thinking about everything and nothing.\n\nThe Hop is different. Late at night, it feels like a different world. I find myself there when I can't sleep, or when I just need to escape the quiet of my own thoughts. It's a strange comfort, being in a place that's usually so full of life, but completely empty.\n\nI feel so guilty about skipping. The deadlines are piling up, and it\u2019s like a physical weight on my chest. So many Wed and Mon deadlines, it\u2019s insane. How am I supposed to catch up when I can barely even start? My knowledge feels like it's just\u2026 gone. Like everything I learned just evaporated. It makes me anxious just thinking about it.\n\nThere were a few moments, though. I remember being at the Admissions Office super early on Thursday and Friday, like 2 AM and 4 AM. I don't even know what I was doing, just moving around, I guess. And then Saturday afternoon, I actually made it to the Boathouse. That was\u2026 nice. Just being by the water, feeling the air. It was a brief escape from the constant hum of worry. And Sunday evening, I was out in Zahm Courtyard. It was quiet, and I just sat there for a bit. Those moments felt like tiny islands in a sea of nothingness.\n\nBut mostly, I feel so disconnected. My social meter is practically at zero. I haven't really talked to anyone, not properly. I see people, but it\u2019s like I\u2019m watching a movie of their lives, not living my own. It makes me feel incredibly lonely, even when I'm surrounded by people. I'm not sure why I'm so bad at reaching out right now. Part of me wants to, but another part just feels too tired, too overwhelmed.\n\nMy happiness is definitely in the gutter. It\u2019s hard to feel happy when you\u2019re constantly battling this internal dread. My sleep is surprisingly okay, which is weird, given how much I'm stressing. Maybe my body just gives up and forces me to sleep. And stamina, well, I'm not exactly running marathons, but I'm not completely drained physically. It's all mental.\n\nNext week\u2026 I need to do something. I *have* to. My goal, my desperate, desperate goal, is to actually go to class. Just one. Or two. Even if I just sit there and absorb nothing, I need to be there. I need to try and talk to someone, anyone, even just a quick chat.

Or, more accurately, a blank. \"No class experience recorded this week.\" Yeah, that about sums it up.\n\nI know I *should* have been in Cummings, LSB, MacLean. I saw the times, I know the buildings. But then Monday rolls around, and instead of being in ENGS 093 or 025, I was at the Boathouse. Just\u2026 there. Doing *something*, I guess, but mostly just existing. It\u2019s weird, because I know I have a lot of knowledge, like my brain is packed with information, but it feels like none of it connects to actually *doing* the things I'm supposed to do. It\u2019s like I have all the ingredients for a cake, but I can\u2019t bring myself to bake it.\n\nAnd the Admissions Office. Why do I keep ending up there? Friday evening, Saturday afternoon, Monday, even Tuesday morning at 5 AM. I wasn't *doing* anything, just\u2026 being near it. Maybe it\u2019s a reminder of how I got here, or how much I wanted to be here, and now I\u2019m just\u2026 adrift. It\u2019s a strange place to find myself, especially when I\u2019m feeling so incredibly unhappy. Like, a 5 out of 100? That\u2019s pretty low.\n\nThe deadlines are just a constant hum in the background, a low-frequency anxiety that never quite goes away. So many of them, piling up for Wednesday and Monday. It\u2019s overwhelming. I look at the list and my brain just shuts down. It\u2019s easier to just\u2026 not look. Or to go to the Boathouse. Or wander near the Admissions Office.\n\nMy social life is basically non-existent right now. A 5? Yeah, that tracks. I haven't really connected with anyone. I guess that contributes to the general gloom. I\u2019m sleeping okay, which is something, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be helping with the overall feeling of dread or the lack of motivation. My stamina is alright, but what\u2019s the point of having energy if you don\u2019t know what to do with it, or if the thought of doing anything just makes you want to curl up?\n\nThe biggest challenge is just\u2026 showing up. Not just physically, but mentally. Being present. I feel like I\u2019m constantly fighting this urge to just disengage, to float through the days. And the deadlines, they\u2019re like a physical weight. I know I have the capacity to understand the material, but the sheer volume of *doing* it feels impossible.\n\nFor next week, I guess the goal is to try and break this cycle. I need to actually *go* to my classes. Not just be in the vicinity of campus, but actually sit in the lecture halls. And those deadlines\u2026 I need to pick one, just one, and try to make a dent in it. Even a tiny dent. And maybe, just maybe, try to say hi to someone. Or respond to a text.

The effective stamina for productive work is very low.\n- **Knowledge:** The student explicitly states, \"I know I have a lot of knowledge, like my brain is packed with information\" and \"I know I have the capacity to understand the material.\" This indicates a high self-perception of their knowledge base, even if they struggle with applying it.\n- **Stress:** The student describes deadlines as \"a constant hum in the background, a low-frequency anxiety that never quite goes away\" and finds them \"overwhelming.\" They also state, \"I look at the list and my brain just shuts down\" and that deadlines are \"like a physical weight,\" all pointing to very high stress levels.\n- **Happy:** The student directly states, \"I\u2019m feeling so incredibly unhappy.

That\u2019s pretty low.\" They also mention a \"general gloom\" and \"overall feeling of dread.\"\n- **Sleep:** The student explicitly says, \"I\u2019m sleeping okay, which is something.\" This suggests a moderate to good level of sleep, not perfect, but not a significant issue.\n- **Social:** The student directly states, \"My social life is basically non-existent right now.

Look at them \u2013 Wed 23:59, Mon 23:59, Tue 23:59, Fri 23:59... it's a never-ending cascade. How am I supposed to even start when there's so much?

It's weird, because my knowledge levels are still high, like I'm absorbing things passively or something, but it's not translating into actual *doing*.\n\nI remember being at the Admissions Office on Friday around noon. \"Activity: No\" is what the data says, and it's so accurate it hurts. I wasn't there for anything specific, just... there. Wandering, I guess. Or maybe just standing still, trying to breathe, trying to figure out what I'm even doing here.

It's a vicious cycle: I'm anxious, so I procrastinate, which makes me more anxious.

Not just physically, but mentally. I need to get to those ENGS classes, even if I just sit there and absorb a fraction of it. And I need to tackle *one* deadline. Just one. Pick the earliest, or the easiest, and just get it done. Maybe if I get one thing off my plate, the rest won't feel so impossible. And maybe, just maybe, I can try to connect with someone, even briefly. My social score is abysmal, and I know isolating myself isn't helping.

The student has clearly put significant effort into identifying a real problem, proposing a targeted solution, and considering the technical feasibility and user experience.\n\nHere's the evaluation:\n\n*   **Is the idea innovative or unique compared to existing apps?**\n    While habit trackers are common, the specific framing around \"micro-habits so small you can't say no,\" the emphasis on \"gentle, non-judgmental\" momentum building for the *overwhelmed* user, and the inclusion of a \"brain dump\" feature specifically for mental clutter, gives \"Momentum Mender\" a distinct and empathetic niche. It's not a revolutionary concept, but it's a well-refined and psychologically informed approach to an existing problem space.\n*   **Does it clearly address a real problem or user need?**\n    Absolutely. The student eloquently describes the common struggle with overwhelm, procrastination, and maintaining consistency, particularly for those feeling low energy or high anxiety. This is a highly relatable and pervasive problem, making the proposed solution genuinely useful. The personal connection articulated by the student further validates the problem's reality.\n*   **Is the idea technically feasible for implementation by a student team within one semester?**\n    Excellent. The student has broken down the core features and explicitly linked them to fundamental smartphone programming concepts (UI/UX, local data persistence, notification APIs, basic custom views). The scope avoids complex external dependencies or advanced algorithms, making it highly achievable within a semester while still providing a complete and functional application.\n*   **Is the scope appropriate (not too simple, not too ambitious)?**\n    The scope is near-perfect. It's substantial enough to demonstrate a wide range of mobile development skills (UI, data, notifications, basic visualization) without being so ambitious that it becomes unmanageable for a semester project. The student also correctly identifies clear pathways for future expansion, showing a good understanding of the project's boundaries.\n*   **Does it demonstrate thoughtful consideration of user experience and impact?**\n    This is a strong point of the proposal. The student has clearly thought about the target user's emotional state and designed features (gentle reminders, minimal setup, focus on tiny wins, brain dump) to directly address feelings of overwhelm and lack of motivation. The emphasis on making progress feel \"easy\" and \"rewarding\" for someone \"running on fumes\" shows deep empathy and a strong user-centered design approach.\n\n**29/30**"}, "weekly_desc": "Ugh.
