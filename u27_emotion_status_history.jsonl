Or maybe, not enough of the right kind of a lot? It\u2019s hard to put my finger on it.\n\nClasses this week felt like they just slipped through my fingers. I honestly don't even remember setting an alarm for most of them. I know I have ECON, JAPN, and COSC, and I really *do* want to do well in them, but when the morning comes, it just feels like I need a bit more time, or I get caught up in something else. I spent a lot of time in Topliff, my dorm, and also a surprising amount of time at the Sphinx Secret Society building. It\u2019s a cool place, and there\u2019s always something going on, or someone to chat with. I guess I just got a bit too comfortable there, and the early classes just didn't happen. It's a bit worrying, honestly, because I know I'm missing out on material, and the deadlines are starting to pile up. There are so many of them, and it feels like they're all coming at once. That's definitely making me feel a bit anxious.\n\nOutside of classes, though, I did get out and about. I was at the Boathouse a couple of times, which is always nice, just being by the water. And I had some \"active\" moments at Fairchild and the Life Sciences Center \u2013 I think I was trying to get some work done there, or maybe just be in an academic environment, even if I wasn't in a lecture. The highlight was definitely going to the Hopkins Center for the Arts on Saturday night and then again late Sunday/early Monday. I love seeing performances or just being in that creative space. It\u2019s a good way to unwind and just experience something different, which I really appreciate. I also popped by the Admissions Office on Friday, not sure why, but it was a brief \"activity.\"\n\nMy sleep has been great, which is good, I guess. I feel rested, but maybe that's part of the problem with getting to those early morning classes. My social battery feels pretty neutral, which is fine. I've been around people, but also had my own space. Stamina is good too, so no excuses there.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely the class attendance. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s easy to get distracted, or to just feel like I can catch up later. But \"later\" is starting to feel like \"never\" with all these deadlines.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to actually *go* to my classes. Seriously. I need to set multiple alarms, maybe even ask a friend to drag me out of bed. I also need to start tackling these deadlines. I'm going to try to spend more focused time in the library or one of the academic buildings, and less time just hanging out when I know I should be studying.

But looking at my schedule and what I actually *did*, it\u2019s clear I need to make some adjustments.\n\nThe big thing that jumps out is the \"no class experience recorded.\" And yeah, that's pretty accurate. I somehow managed to miss all my scheduled classes this week \u2013 ECON, JAPN, COSC\u2026 I just didn't make it to any of them. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t *want* to go, it\u2019s just that mornings are tough, and then I get caught up in other things. I spent a lot of time at Topliff, just chilling, and then a *lot* of time at the Sphinx Secret Society. It\u2019s a really comfortable place, and I ended up hanging out there quite a bit, sometimes late into the night. I mean, I was there for a good chunk of Thursday and Friday mornings when I should have been in class. It\u2019s easy to lose track of time when you\u2019re just relaxing or chatting with people. My social meter feels okay, so I guess all that time at Sphinx helped with that.\n\nI did have a few moments where I was \"active\" in academic buildings, like the Life Sciences Center and Fairchild, but those weren't for my actual classes. It's like I was *around* the academic vibe, but not quite *in* it. I even made it to the Hopkins Center late one night, which was a cool experience, and Sudikoff Hall another night. So I'm not just holed up, which is good.\n\nThe thing that\u2019s starting to nag at me, though, is the sheer number of deadlines coming up. There are so many, spread across every day of the week, and I haven't been in class to really keep up with what's expected. My knowledge level is still pretty high, which is a relief, but I know that\u2019s not going to last if I keep skipping lectures. It\u2019s a bit worrying, actually. I feel like I\u2019m falling behind, and that makes me a little anxious.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is simple but crucial: I *have* to go to class. Seriously. Every single one. I need to set alarms, maybe even ask a friend to drag me out of bed if necessary. I also need to start tackling those deadlines. Maybe I can use some of the time I usually spend at Sphinx to actually study, or at least find a quieter spot in one of the academic buildings to get some work done.

There was always something going on, or just people to hang out with. I was there for hours, sometimes just chilling, sometimes really active. It\u2019s hard to say no when everyone\u2019s around and the vibe is just so good. My social battery feels pretty charged, which is nice. And the boathouse! I was there a few times too, which was a good way to get some energy out and clear my head. It\u2019s a nice change of pace from everything else.\n\nBut, and this is a big but, looking at my schedule and what I actually *did*, I barely stepped foot in a classroom. Like, at all. I completely missed all my ECON, JAPN, and COSC classes. It\u2019s a bit jarring to see that written down, honestly. I know I *should* have been there. I mean, I'm getting plenty of sleep and I feel good physically, my stamina's great, but my brain is a little fuzzy on the academic front.

I did make it to the library for a bit on Wednesday, which was a start, but it was just a tiny drop in the bucket compared to what I need to do.\n\nSo, for next week, I absolutely *have* to prioritize my classes. No more skipping. I need to actually *be* in Silsby-Rocky, Bartlett, and LSB when I'm supposed to be. I need to figure out what I missed and catch up, especially with all these deadlines looming. I think I need to make a proper schedule and actually stick to it, even if it means saying no to some social stuff at the Sphinx.

But looking back, there's definitely a part of me that's a little uneasy.\n\nThe biggest thing that stands out is class attendance. Or, well, the lack of it. \"No class experience recorded this week\" is painfully accurate. I didn't make it to a single ECON, JAPN, or COSC lecture. It's not like I don't *want* to go, or that I don't care about the material. It's just... the mornings came, and I was either still in Topliff or, more often than not, caught up in something at Sphinx. I know I should be in Silsby-Rocky for ECON, or LSB for COSC, or Bartlett for JAPN, but I just wasn't there. It\u2019s a weird feeling, knowing I\u2019m missing out on so much. I can already feel the knowledge gaps forming, and that's a bit stressful, especially with all these deadlines piling up. Seriously, looking at the list, it feels like there's something due every single day next week.\n\nMy social life, though, has been pretty active. Sphinx has been a huge part of my week. I spent a lot of late nights and early mornings there, and there's always something happening. It's a really welcoming place, and I find myself just gravitating there. I also managed to get out to the Boathouse a few times, which was nice, and even Memorial Field for a bit. I did make it to Baker-Berry Library on Friday and Monday, which is a small win, but probably not enough study time given everything I've missed. It's easy to get swept up in the social side of things, and I guess I'm pretty agreeable, so it's hard to say no when friends are around or something fun is happening.\n\nThe main challenge for me right now is definitely balancing everything. I feel good socially and physically, but the academic side is starting to weigh on me. Missing all those classes this week is a big deal, and I'm starting to feel that familiar knot of anxiety about falling behind. It's like I know what I *should* be doing, but actually doing it is another story.\n\nSo, for next week, my absolute top priority has to be class attendance. I need to be in those lectures, no excuses. I'm going to set multiple alarms, maybe even try to coordinate with a friend to walk to class together. Beyond that, I need to dedicate some serious time to catching up on the material I missed in ECON, JAPN, and COSC. And those deadlines... I need to get a clear plan for tackling them. I also need to remember to check on FILM 042 since that's still TBA. It's time to shift gears and get back on track academically.

Yeah, I didn't make it to any of them this week. Not a single one. ECON, JAPN, COSC... all missed. It's a bit embarrassing to write that down, but it's the truth. My class experience summary says \"No class experience recorded,\" and that's painfully accurate. I know I *should* be there, especially with all these deadlines popping up. There are so many due dates coming up \u2013 multiple things on Monday, Friday, Thursday, Tuesday, Wednesday... it's a lot to keep track of, and I'm definitely not feeling on top of it.\n\nSo, what *was* I doing? Mostly, I was at Sphinx. Like, a *lot*. It's such a cool place, and there's always something going on, or just people to hang out with. My social battery is absolutely full, which is great, and my social stat is at 95, so that checks out. I was also back and forth to Topliff, my dorm, quite a bit. The nights just kind of... stretched out. I was up super late almost every night, bouncing between Sphinx and my room. It's weird, my sleep stat is 95, which makes it sound like I'm getting tons of rest, and I guess I am, but it's probably because I'm sleeping in until noon or later most days. My stamina is still high, though, so I'm not feeling completely drained.\n\nI did manage to get out a bit, which was nice. Spent some time down at the Boathouse, just chilling by the water. And I ended up at McNutt Hall a couple of times \u2013 not sure why, just ended up there. It was interesting, I guess.\n\nThe weirdest part is my knowledge stat is at 90. I mean, I *feel* like I know things, generally, but definitely not the specific stuff from this week's lectures! I guess that's more about general knowledge than what I'm supposed to be learning in my courses right now. That's probably where the little knot in my stomach comes from. I'm usually pretty good about keeping up, but this week just got away from me.\n\nI did have a moment, late Tuesday night, where I was actually in Reed Hall, a classroom building, for an hour. And then on Wednesday, I spent some time at Baker-Berry Library. It felt good to actually be in an academic space, even if it was just for a little while. It was like a small reminder of what I'm actually here for.\n\nSo, looking ahead to next week, I really need to turn this around. My goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Attend all my classes.** Seriously. No more excuses. I need to be in Silsby-Rocky, Bartlett, and LSB when I'm supposed to be.\n2.  **Start tackling those deadlines.** I need to figure out what's due first and just get started. Even if it's just an hour or two each day, it'll make a difference.\n3.  **Balance social time.** I love hanging out at Sphinx, but maybe not until 3 AM every night. I need to set some boundaries so I can actually be awake and functional for morning classes.\n4.  **Re-engage with the material.** I'm going to try and catch up on what I missed this week. Maybe hit the library more consistently.\n\nI feel pretty good overall, but there's this nagging feeling that I'm letting things slide academically.

I mean, I was there for hours on end, sometimes even overnight. It's a really welcoming place, and I find myself just gravitating there.\n\nI did manage to get some activity in, though. Spent a good amount of time at the Boathouse, which was great. I love being out on the water, it's a good way to clear my head and get some exercise. There were a few \"activity: yes\" moments there, which felt productive. I also popped into McNutt Hall for a bit, and even Fairchild Physical Sciences Center, though I'm not sure what I was doing there for long. It wasn't exactly studying, that's for sure.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week is definitely the complete lack of class attendance.

Maybe dedicate specific blocks of time in a library or my dorm, away from the Sphinx gravitational pull.\n3.  **Find a better balance.** I love my social life and the Boathouse, but it can't come at the expense of my studies.

That thought definitely makes me a little anxious.\n\nSo, for next week, the goal is pretty clear: I *have* to get back into my classes. No excuses. I need to figure out what I missed in ECON, JAPN, and COSC, and start chipping away at those deadlines. I also want to try and find a better balance. I love spending time with my friends, and I don't want to cut that out, but I need to make sure it's not at the expense of my studies. Maybe I can try to get some studying done *with* friends, or at least schedule my social time around my classes more intentionally. It's time to be a bit more conscientious about my academic responsibilities.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina:** Chosen as 90 because the student explicitly states, \"My stamina is good, I'm not tired.\"\n- **Knowledge:** Chosen as 10 due to the student admitting, \"I didn't make it to any of my classes this week.

Honestly, I feel pretty good overall, which is a nice change of pace. My social battery is definitely full, and I've been getting a ton of sleep, which always helps keep my spirits up. Stamina feels great too, so no complaints there.\n\nI spent a *lot* of time at the Sphinx Secret Society this week, which was really fun. It felt like there was always something going on, or just good company to be around. It's easy to lose track of time there, just hanging out and chatting. I also managed to get out to the Boathouse a couple of times, which is always a nice way to clear my head, and even spent some time at Fairchild, though I'm not sure what I was really doing there. Just exploring, I guess. It's good to be active and see different parts of campus.\n\nNow, for the less-than-stellar part of the week. Classes. Yeah, I know. I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. Not a single one. It's a bit embarrassing to admit, especially with all the deadlines starting to pile up. I saw a bunch of them pop up \u2013 for Monday, Friday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday... it's a lot. There's this nagging feeling in the back of my mind about ECON, JAPN, and COSC, and even FILM, which I still need to figure out. I know I *should* have been there, and it's not like I was too tired or anything. I just... wasn't. I guess I got a bit caught up in everything else. My knowledge feels pretty solid generally, but I know that's not the same as keeping up with specific course material.\n\nIt's a weird balance, feeling so happy and socially fulfilled, but also having this underlying anxiety about falling behind academically. I really value my friendships and the experiences I'm having outside of class, but I also know why I'm here.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is to get back on track with my academics. I need to actually *go* to my classes. That's step one. I also need to start looking at those deadlines more seriously and figure out a plan for tackling them. Maybe I can try to dedicate specific blocks of time in the library or Sudikoff, even if it's just to review what I missed. I want to keep up the good social vibes, but I need to find a way to integrate my studies better. It's all about finding that balance, right?

It feels like a blur, honestly.\n\nThis past week was... different. I definitely didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes, which is a bit of a bummer. ECON, JAPN, COSC \u2013 all missed. I know I should have been there, especially with all the deadlines piling up. It's not like I don't care, it's just that I got really, really caught up in things at the Sphinx Secret Society. It was just so immersive, and there was always something going on, or people to talk to, or just a really good vibe. I spent so much time there, it felt like a whole world. I guess that explains why my social battery is completely full, and I'm feeling pretty happy overall. It was just a really good time connecting with people and being part of something.\n\nMy sleep has been surprisingly good, which is a relief, and I feel like I have plenty of stamina. So, physically, I'm doing great. Socially, I'm thriving, which is awesome.\n\nThe challenge, though, is definitely the academic side. With no class experience recorded, I know I've fallen behind. It hit me hard on Sunday night, and then again on Monday and Tuesday, when I finally dragged myself to Sudikoff Hall. Those late nights and early mornings in the CS building were a scramble to catch up, especially for COSC. It's like I procrastinate, and then the anxiety of the deadlines kicks in, and I just have to power through. It's not the most efficient way to learn, and I can feel that my actual knowledge in the subjects is probably pretty low right now, despite feeling generally smart.\n\nLooking at all those deadlines for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday... it's a lot. I really need to get a handle on this.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to actually *attend* my classes. Seriously. I need to be in Silsby-Rocky for ECON, Bartlett for JAPN, and LSB for COSC. I also need to figure out what's going on with FILM 042 since it's TBA. I can't keep letting the social stuff completely overshadow my academics, even if it's super fun. I want to find a better balance, so I can still enjoy my time with friends and at the society, but also stay on top of my coursework without those last-minute panic sessions.

Stamina's up there too, so I guess I'm doing something right on that front.\n\nAcademically, though, it's a bit of a mixed bag. I have to admit, I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. I know, I know, it's not ideal. Friday was a bit of a blur, honestly. I was at the Sphinx building for most of the morning, and then back at Topliff. It just felt like there was so much going on, and getting to those early classes felt like a huge hurdle. I really need to figure out a better routine for that.\n\nMost of my time outside of my dorm seemed to be spent at the Sphinx Secret Society building. There was a lot happening there, and I ended up spending a good chunk of my evenings and even some late nights there. I had a really good time, and it definitely explains why my social stats are so high. It's easy to get caught up in things when you're having fun and surrounded by good people. I even had a late night at Sudikoff on Friday, which was probably me trying to catch up on COSC stuff after missing class. It felt good to actually get some work done, even if it was late.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely going to be catching up on what I missed in ECON, Japanese, and COSC. It's a bit daunting looking at all those upcoming deadlines, especially with a few due on Monday and Friday. I feel a little bit of that familiar pressure building up, knowing I've got to put in the extra effort now.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to get back on track with class attendance. I really need to make it to those lectures, especially with so many deadlines looming. I also want to dedicate more focused time to studying, especially for COSC and ECON, to make sure I'm not falling too far behind.
