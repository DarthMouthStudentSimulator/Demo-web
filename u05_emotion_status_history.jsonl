Looking back, I definitely didn't stick to my usual routine, especially when it came to classes. It's a bit embarrassing to admit, but I didn't make it to any of my scheduled lectures this week. I saw COSC 050, PSYC 028, and COSC 065 on my schedule, and I know I *should* have been there, but somehow, I just kept finding myself elsewhere.\n\nA lot of my time seemed to be spent at the 1953 Commons. I mean, it's a central spot, good for grabbing food, but I spent an unusual amount of time there just... being. Sometimes I was trying to focus on readings, other times just zoning out. It felt like a default location when I wasn't sure what else to do, or maybe when I was avoiding something.\n\nMy main productive bursts seemed to happen later in the day. Thursday evening, I was definitely in Sudikoff Hall, which means I was probably deep into some COSC problem sets. And then late Thursday night, I was in Reed Hall, which usually means I'm cramming or working on something pretty intensely. Same for Tuesday evening, back in Sudikoff. It's like I'm trying to make up for lost time by pulling these concentrated study sessions, especially with all those deadlines looming. There are so many due dates coming up \u2013 multiple things for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. It's a lot to keep track of, and it definitely adds to the pressure.\n\nOn the social side, the Boathouse was a consistent presence. I was there Wednesday evening, Thursday morning (super early!), Friday evening, and then late Saturday night, and again Monday afternoon, evening, and late night. It's clearly a place where I feel comfortable and engaged. It's good to have that outlet, a place to connect and unwind, especially when the academic pressure feels high. My social meter is at 50, which feels about right \u2013 I'm getting out there, but maybe not as much as I could be, or perhaps the interactions aren't fully recharging me.\n\nDespite missing classes and feeling a bit scattered, my sleep and stamina are surprisingly at 100. I guess I'm managing to get enough rest, even with the late-night study sessions or social activities. That's a relief, because I know how quickly things can spiral when you're sleep-deprived. My happiness is at 50, which is just average. I think it reflects the internal conflict of knowing I'm not hitting my academic marks, even if I'm physically well-rested. My knowledge is also at 50, and I can feel that gap from not attending lectures.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was definitely my class attendance. It's a pattern I need to break. I feel a bit behind already, and that's a stressful feeling for me, especially with so many assignments due. I need to be more disciplined and proactive.\n\nFor next week, my primary goal is to get back on track with my classes. I *have* to attend every single lecture. I need to make sure I'm physically in the classroom, absorbing the material directly. I also want to dedicate specific, uninterrupted blocks of time to each course, rather than just reacting to deadlines. I'll try to break down those upcoming assignments into smaller, manageable chunks so they don't feel so overwhelming. And while the Boathouse is great, I need to make sure it's complementing my academic life, not replacing it.

It's frustrating to be in the CS building and still not feel like I'm making progress, but at least I was *there*.

That \"Yes\" activity at Sudikoff on Thursday and then at Reed Hall on Monday was definitely me deep in the zone, trying to tackle problems.\n\nThe big elephant in the room, though, is my class attendance. Looking at my schedule and then at where I actually was, it's clear I missed every single one of my classes this week. COSC 065, COSC 050, PSYC 028 \u2013 I wasn't in any of them. That's a huge concern. Part of it is the sheer exhaustion from the late-night work sessions, and part of it is just getting caught up in the flow of other things on campus.\n\nSpeaking of which, I spent an incredible amount of time at the 1953 Commons. My social score is through the roof at 95, and I guess that's why. It's such a great place to catch up with friends, grab food, and just be around people. I love that aspect of campus life, and it definitely helps keep my happiness at a decent 70, even when I'm running on empty. I also managed to get out to the Boathouse a couple of times, including a \"Yes\" activity there on Friday evening, which was a nice break. And Sunday night at the Hopkins Center was a good way to unwind before the new week. It's good to have those social and recreational outlets, but I need to figure out how to integrate them without sacrificing my academic responsibilities.\n\nThe sheer number of deadlines coming up, especially for Monday and Tuesday, definitely added to the pressure and probably contributed to those late nights. It feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up.\n\nFor next week, my absolute top priority is getting more sleep. I can't function like this. I also *have* to start attending all my classes. I'm missing out on valuable information, and relying solely on self-study isn't sustainable in the long run. I need to be more disciplined with my time management, especially when it comes to starting assignments earlier to avoid those all-nighters. I want to keep my social life active, but I need to set better boundaries and make sure my time at the Commons isn't replacing my time in lectures or dedicated study. It's all about finding that balance.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina:** The student explicitly states, \"My sleep and stamina are both at a 5,\" and mentions \"running on fumes\" and \"sheer exhaustion from the late-night work sessions,\" indicating extremely low stamina.\n- **Knowledge:** The student reports, \"my knowledge scores are still pretty solid,\" and feels they were \"making good progress\" and \"deep in the zone, trying to tackle problems,\" suggesting a good grasp of the material despite missed classes.\n- **Stress:** The student highlights \"all those deadlines looming,\" feeling \"added to the pressure,\" and \"constantly playing catch-up,\" along with the \"serious grind\" of late nights and concern over missing classes, all pointing to high stress.\n- **Happy:** The student directly states that their social activities \"definitely helps keep my happiness at a decent 70,\" even amidst exhaustion, and mentions positive outlets like the Boathouse and Hopkins Center.\n- **Sleep:** The student explicitly states, \"My sleep and stamina are both at a 5,\" and emphasizes \"pulling those late nights\" and that getting \"more sleep\" is their \"absolute top priority,\" confirming severe sleep deprivation.\n- **Social:** The student explicitly states, \"My social score is through the roof at 95,\" and describes spending an \"incredible amount of time at the 1953 Commons\" and loving \"that aspect of campus life,\" indicating a very active and fulfilling social life."}

It feels like a blur, honestly. My head's still spinning a bit, and I'm definitely feeling the weight of everything.\n\nThis week was... a lot. Looking at my schedule, it was packed with classes, but the reality was I barely made it to any of them. I know, I know, it's not ideal, especially with how conscientious I usually try to be. My sleep has been absolutely abysmal, and I think that's the biggest culprit. Running on fumes with only 5 hours of sleep and stamina at 5 just makes it impossible to drag myself out of bed for those morning lectures, or even the afternoon ones sometimes. It's a cycle \u2013 I'm tired, so I miss class, then I feel guilty and try to catch up late at night, which just makes me more tired.\n\nDespite missing classes, I was definitely out and about. My social score is through the roof, which is great in some ways. I spent a lot of time at the Commons, just hanging out, grabbing meals, and catching up with people. There were a few late nights at the Boathouse, which is always fun, and I even managed to catch a couple of events at the Hopkins Center. It's good to feel connected and see friends, and I really value those interactions. I even ended up at a fraternity house one night, which was a bit of a spontaneous decision. It's easy to get swept up in everything happening on campus.\n\nBut then there's the academic side. I know I have a ton of deadlines coming up \u2013 seriously, so many for Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. It's a bit overwhelming to see them all stacked up. I tried to compensate for missing lectures by spending a good chunk of time at Sudikoff, especially towards the end of the week. I was there for hours on Sunday and Tuesday, just trying to work through problem sets and review material for COSC. My knowledge scores are still pretty decent, which is a relief, but I worry about how long I can maintain that without the direct instruction from class. It feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was definitely the sleep deprivation and the resulting lack of energy. It impacts everything \u2013 my focus, my mood, and obviously, my attendance. I feel a bit of a knot in my stomach thinking about all the material I missed in COSC 050, PSYC 028, and COSC 065. I pride myself on being organized and on top of things, so this feels like a real slip.\n\nFor next week, my absolute top priority has to be sleep. I need to figure out a way to get more consistent, quality rest. That means being more disciplined about my evenings, even if it means saying no to some late-night social plans. I also *have* to get back to attending all my classes. It's non-negotiable. I know the material is building, and I can't afford to fall further behind, especially with all these deadlines looming. I need to use my time in Sudikoff more efficiently, maybe even try to get ahead on some readings or assignments so I'm not scrambling at the last minute. It's all about finding that balance between staying connected and staying on track academically. I'm determined to turn this around.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: The student explicitly states, \"Running on fumes with only 5 hours of sleep and stamina at 5\" and identifies \"the resulting lack of energy\" as a major challenge, indicating extremely low stamina.\n- **Knowledge**: The student reports, \"My knowledge scores are still pretty decent, which is a relief,\" suggesting a good current understanding.

It feels like a bit of a blur, honestly, but also incredibly productive in some ways. My brain feels full, which is great for knowledge, but my body is definitely feeling the strain.\n\nAcademically, I spent a *lot* of time in Sudikoff Hall this week. It felt like my second home, especially with those late-night sessions. I was there until 1 AM on Thursday, then again until 5 AM on Wednesday morning. It\u2019s clear I was really diving deep into COSC work, and I feel like my understanding of the material is really solid, which is reflected in my high knowledge score. There are so many deadlines coming up \u2013 a bunch on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday \u2013 so I felt like I had to be constantly working to stay on top of everything.\n\nThe downside of that intense focus on CS, and the late nights, is that my class attendance wasn't as consistent as I'd like. I missed a few PSYC 028 lectures, and even some COSC 065 and COSC 050 classes. For example, on Thursday, I was in Sudikoff during PSYC, and on Monday, I was at Zimmerman Hall really early, then in Sudikoff during my other classes. Tuesday, I was in the Commons during COSC 050, and today (Wednesday), I missed both COSC 065 and COSC 050 while I was in the Commons and then over at the Life Sciences Center. It's a tough balance, and I know I learn best when I'm actually in the lecture, so that's something I definitely need to address.\n\nOn the social front, things are fantastic! My social score is super high, and I've been making sure to connect with people. I spent a lot of time at the Boathouse, which is always a great way to unwind and hang out. Even just being in the Class of 1953 Commons so much, especially late at night or early in the morning, means I'm around people, whether I'm eating or just taking a break. It's been really good for my happiness, even when everything else feels a bit chaotic. I even managed to squeeze in a gym session on Thursday, which was a nice break.\n\nThe biggest challenge, without a doubt, is sleep. My sleep and stamina are both critically low. I'm running on fumes, and it's catching up to me. Those late nights working on assignments, combined with early mornings, mean I'm just not getting enough rest. I feel productive and engaged when I'm awake, but I know this isn't sustainable in the long run.\n\nOverall, I'm still feeling pretty happy, which is a testament to how much I enjoy my classes and my social life here. But the exhaustion is real.\n\nFor next week, my main goals are clear:\n1.  **Prioritize sleep:** I absolutely need to get more rest. I'm going to try to set a stricter bedtime and stick to it, even if it means being more efficient with my daytime study hours.\n2.  **Improve class attendance:** I need to make a conscious effort to be in every lecture. I'll try to get ahead on assignments earlier in the week to reduce the need for those late-night crunches that make me miss morning classes.\n3.  **Maintain balance:** Keep up with my social connections, as they're clearly a huge positive for me, but find a way to integrate them without sacrificing essential sleep or class time. Maybe more focused study blocks so I can truly relax when I'm socializing.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina:** 10 was chosen because the student explicitly states, \"My sleep and stamina are both critically low,\" and \"I'm running on fumes, and it's catching up to me.\" They also mention \"my body is definitely feeling the strain\" and \"The exhaustion is real.\"\n- **Knowledge:** 90 was chosen as the student reports, \"My brain feels full, which is great for knowledge,\" and \"I feel like my understanding of the material is really solid, which is reflected in my high knowledge score.\"\n- **Stress:** 90 was chosen due to the student's description of \"so many deadlines coming up \u2013 a bunch on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday \u2013 so I felt like I had to be constantly working to stay on top of everything.\" They also note, \"even when everything else feels a bit chaotic.\"\n- **Happy:** 75 was chosen because despite the challenges, the student states, \"Overall, I'm still feeling pretty happy, which is a testament to how much I enjoy my classes and my social life here,\" and \"It's been really good for my happiness.\"\n- **Sleep:** 10 was chosen because the student identifies sleep as \"The biggest challenge, without a doubt,\" stating, \"My sleep and stamina are both critically low,\" and \"I'm just not getting enough rest.\" They also prioritize, \"I absolutely need to get more rest.\"\n- **Social:** 95 was chosen as the student enthusiastically declares, \"On the social front, things are fantastic!
