Looking back, it\u2019s pretty clear I didn\u2019t make it to any of my actual classes, which is a bit of a wake-up call. It\u2019s not like I was exhausted or anything \u2013 my sleep and stamina have been great, actually. I just seemed to be elsewhere.\n\nOn Wednesday, instead of being in COSC 065 or 089, I was hitting the gym at Berry Sports Center and then Leverone. Good workout, but definitely not class. Later in the day, I was down by the Boathouse. Thursday was similar; I missed my COSC 065 and TUCK 003 classes. I was at the Life Sciences Center for a bit, and then back at the Boathouse. It feels like I spent a lot of time by the water this week.\n\nFriday was another day of missed classes. I was actually at the Admissions Office for a while in the afternoon, which was interesting, but it meant I wasn't in COSC 065 or 089. I did have some activity later in the evening, but it was pretty vague.\n\nThe weekend was a mix. Saturday, I found myself out at Glen Road Plaza, which is definitely not campus. Just doing some errands, I guess. Sunday was pretty quiet, not much going on until later in the afternoon.\n\nThen Monday rolled around, and again, no classes for me. I was at the Boathouse again in the early afternoon, and then later at the Admissions Office. I did have some activity late at night, but it wasn't academic. And Tuesday, my TUCK 003 class was scheduled for Carson-Tech Services, but I was over in Sudikoff Hall around that time. So, I was in a CS building, just not where I was supposed to be for class.\n\nIt\u2019s weird because I know I have a lot of deadlines coming up \u2013 seriously, there are so many, especially next week. My conscientiousness is definitely kicking in now, realizing I've let things slide a bit. My knowledge level is probably reflecting my attendance, which is a bit concerning. My social life has been okay, just average, so it's not like I was out being super social instead of studying. I think I just got a bit sidetracked, maybe exploring other things or just not feeling the pull of lectures.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was definitely my lack of engagement with my actual coursework. I feel a bit behind now, and the sheer number of upcoming deadlines is a bit daunting.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Attend all my scheduled classes.** No more missing lectures. I need to get back into the routine and absorb the material directly.\n2.  **Start tackling those deadlines.** I need to prioritize and make a plan to chip away at the assignments. My conscientiousness needs to take the lead here.\n3.  **Find a better balance.** I enjoy being active and exploring, but it can't come at the expense of my academics.

COSC 089, COSC 050, TUCK 003, COSC 065\u2026 all of them. The class experience summary says \"No class experience recorded,\" and that's painfully accurate. It's like I just couldn't bring myself to go, even though I know I should have been there. I saw I was at the Boathouse a couple of times on Thursday, which was nice for a bit, and then there were those random bursts of activity late at night or super early in the morning, mostly in unknown places. I guess I was just... doing other things? Or maybe just not tracking properly. It's frustrating because I know I *should* be in class, especially with all these deadlines piling up. Seriously, there are so many due next week, especially Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It's a bit overwhelming to look at.\n\nI did manage to get to Sudikoff on Tuesday afternoon, which was good. I think I spent some time in the CS lab there, trying to catch up on something, but it felt like too little, too late for the whole week. My knowledge level is supposed to be high, but I feel like I'm actively sabotaging it by not showing up. It's a weird feeling, like I know what I *should* be doing, and I want to do it, but then I just... don't.\n\nThis whole situation is making me feel pretty stressed, which probably explains the low happiness.

Not a single one. COSC 089, COSC 050, TUCK 003, COSC 065\u2026 I just couldn't bring myself to go. It\u2019s not like I was out partying or anything. Most of the time, the logs just say \"No activity\" or \"Unknown location.\" It feels like I just existed, rather than actively participated in anything.\n\nI did find myself wandering around campus a bit. Spent a surprising amount of time at the Boathouse \u2013 it\u2019s peaceful there, a good place to just\u2026 be. I also ended up near the Admissions Office a few times. Not sure why, just ended up there. And Fairchild Physical Sciences Center, too, though not for any specific class. It\u2019s like I was trying to be productive, or at least in the vicinity of productivity, but the actual work just wasn't happening. There were those odd early morning activities too, like 3 or 4 AM, which probably means my sleep schedule is more erratic than the \"100\" score suggests. Maybe I'm just sleeping *a lot* to compensate for feeling so low.\n\nMy social score is sitting at 50, which feels about right. I haven't really connected with anyone properly this week. It\u2019s hard to reach out when you feel this disengaged.\n\nAnd the deadlines\u2026 oh god, the deadlines. Looking at the list, it\u2019s just a wall of them, especially for next week. Wednesday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Friday\u2026 they\u2019re all piling up. My conscientiousness is screaming at me, telling me I should be on top of this, but the motivation just isn't there.

My knowledge score is high, which is good, but it doesn't mean much if I'm not applying it or learning new things in class.\n\nSo, for next week, I really need to turn this around. My main goal is simple: **attend all my classes.** Just showing up would be a huge step. Then, I need to start chipping away at these deadlines. I can\u2019t let them overwhelm me. I need to break them down into smaller, manageable tasks. Maybe I can try to connect with a friend or two, too.

That just didn't happen.\n\nMy stamina is just completely shot, which probably explains a lot. I feel drained, like I'm running on fumes. Most of my time was spent just... being.

I did manage to get to the library on Wednesday for a bit, which was good, felt like I was at least *trying* to be productive.

I spent a lot of time there \u2013 Wednesday evening, then Thursday afternoon and evening, and again Friday and Monday, even Tuesday evening. It's a huge commitment, and while I love being out on the water, it really takes it out of me physically. That probably explains the stamina crash.

I've been helping out with some prospective student tours and general office tasks, which is rewarding, but it adds another layer to the daily grind.\n\nMy social life feels pretty balanced, I guess.

Sleep-wise, I seem to be doing okay, which is a relief, because if I wasn't getting enough sleep on top of everything else, I'd probably be completely burnt out.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely balancing everything.

Time to actually sit down and think about what happened, or, more accurately, what *didn't* happen.\n\nHonestly, this week felt like a blur, and not in a good way. Looking at my schedule, I had all these classes \u2013 COSC 089, COSC 050, TUCK 003, COSC 065 \u2013 and I just\u2026 didn't make it to any of them. Not a single one. That's a pretty big deal, and it's weighing on me. My stamina is practically non-existent, which explains a lot. It felt like pulling myself out of bed was a monumental task, let alone getting to Sudikoff or Kemeny for lectures. I'd be near campus, like by the Boathouse or just around Maynard Street, but the energy to actually *go in* and engage just wasn't there.\n\nIt's weird because I feel like I *know* a lot of the material, or at least I did. My knowledge stats are still pretty high, which is a small comfort, but it's not helping me actually *do* anything right now. I'm just so tired. That low stamina score is really hitting home. And my happiness? Yeah, 20. That tracks. It's hard to feel good when you're constantly battling exhaustion and the guilt of not showing up.\n\nSocially, I tried a little. I had some activity on Wednesday and Thursday evening, and then again on Saturday and Monday. I even ended up at Hanover High on Friday night, which was... unexpected. And a quick trip to the Post Office on Sunday. But even with those moments, my social score is still low. It feels like I'm just floating through, not really connecting or getting that boost from being around people. I think the exhaustion just makes me want to retreat.\n\nThe biggest looming cloud is definitely the deadlines. There are so many of them, especially for Wednesday, Sunday, and Monday. It's overwhelming to look at, especially when I haven't been in class to even hear about them properly. I know I'm falling behind, and that just adds to the stress. My neuroticism is probably spiking just thinking about it.\n\nThis can't keep happening. I pride myself on being conscientious, and this week was the opposite of that. I need to figure out what's draining me so much.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear, even if they feel daunting:\n1.  **Prioritize rest:** I need to get my stamina back up. This means actual, quality sleep, not just lying in bed.\n2.  **Get back to class:** Even if I feel behind, I need to show up. Just being there is a start. I'll aim for at least one class each day to begin with.\n3.  **Tackle deadlines strategically:** I need to break down those assignments. Maybe pick one or two of the most urgent ones and just focus on those first, rather than getting paralyzed by the sheer number.\n4.  **Re-engage socially:** Find a low-key way to connect with friends, even if it's just a quick coffee or a study session. My social battery needs a recharge too.\n\nI know I can do better than this.

Or, well, mostly down. Honestly, I'm just feeling completely drained. My stamina is practically non-existent, and I can tell my sleep has been all over the place. It's like I'm constantly playing catch-up, but the finish line keeps moving further away.\n\nAcademically, this week was... rough. I'm looking at my schedule, and it's pretty clear I didn't make it to any of my actual classes. COSC 089, COSC 050, TUCK 003, COSC 065 \u2013 I missed them all. It's frustrating because I know the material, my knowledge scores are decent, but actually getting myself to class felt impossible. I spent so much time in Sudikoff, especially late at night, trying to chip away at assignments. Sunday night, I was there until the early hours of Monday morning, just trying to get things done. And then again on Tuesday afternoon. It feels like I'm constantly working, but not on the right things, or not efficiently. The sheer number of deadlines looming over me is just overwhelming \u2013 there's something due almost every day next week.\n\nMy sleep has been a mess. I'm seeing these \"Activity: Yes\" timestamps at 1 AM, 2 AM, 2 AM, 2 AM... it's just not sustainable. No wonder my sleep score is so low. And with that, my happiness and social scores have taken a hit too. I haven't really connected with anyone properly. I grabbed food at the Commons on Friday and Saturday, but it was more about fueling up than actually socializing. I feel pretty isolated right now.\n\nI found myself wandering a bit this week. Spent some time at the Boathouse, which is usually a good way to clear my head, but even that felt like a chore. I was at Vail a couple of times, and Fairchild too \u2013 just trying to find different spots to work, I guess, or maybe just to escape my dorm for a bit. The Admissions Office visits were a bit random, but sometimes it's good to just be around other people, even if you're not interacting much.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely this cycle of missing classes because I'm exhausted from trying to catch up on work, which then makes me fall further behind. It's a vicious loop. My conscientiousness is screaming at me to get it together, but my body just isn't cooperating.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to break this cycle. My main goal is to actually attend my classes. Even if I'm tired, I need to be there. I also need to figure out a better way to manage these deadlines. Maybe breaking them down into smaller chunks, or trying to get a head start on things earlier in the week instead of pulling all-nighters right before they're due. And honestly, I need to prioritize sleep. If I can get my sleep back on track, I think everything else \u2013 my stamina, my happiness, even my ability to focus in class \u2013 will start to improve. I also want to try and reach out to someone, even just for a quick chat.

I'm looking at my status and it's pretty clear why \u2013 my happiness, sleep, social life, and stamina are all in the red. It's a tough pill to swallow, especially when I know I've got a good grasp on the material, but just *getting* to it feels like climbing a mountain right now.\n\nThe biggest thing that stands out is how little I actually made it to my classes. I saw the schedule, I know where I'm supposed to be \u2013 Sudikoff for COSC 089, Kemeny for COSC 050, Carson for TUCK 003, LSB for COSC 065. But when I look back, it's just a lot of \"No activity\" during those times. I feel a bit guilty about it, to be honest. My conscientiousness is usually pretty high, and skipping classes isn't something I like to do. It's just that the exhaustion has been so overwhelming. My stamina is practically non-existent, and sleep feels like a luxury I can't afford with all these deadlines looming.\n\nSpeaking of deadlines, that's definitely the elephant in the room. Looking at the sheer number of assignments due in the coming days \u2013 multiple ones on Wednesday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday \u2013 it's just a constant weight. It feels like I'm always playing catch-up, and every time I think I'm getting ahead, another one pops up. That's probably why my sleep is so low; I've been trying to cram in work whenever I can, even if it means sacrificing rest.\n\nMy \"activity\" outside of class seems to have been pretty sporadic too. I remember that quick trip to the real estate office on Wednesday \u2013 just trying to sort out some future housing stuff, which felt like another chore on top of everything else. And then there were those random bursts of \"Activity: Yes\" at unknown locations. Those were probably me just hunkering down wherever I could find a quiet spot to try and chip away at assignments, or maybe just trying to get some basic life stuff done. I even found myself near the Boathouse and Vail, but I wasn't really *doing* anything there, just kind of existing.\n\nMy social life has taken a huge hit, which makes me feel a bit isolated. I haven't really connected with anyone this week, and that's probably contributing to the low happiness score. It's hard to be outgoing when you're running on fumes.\n\nThe main challenge this week has been managing the sheer volume of work while feeling completely drained. It's a vicious cycle: I'm tired, so I don't go to class, then I have to teach myself the material, which takes more time, leading to less sleep, and so on.\n\nFor next week, I really need to turn this around. My goals are:\n1.  **Prioritize sleep:** I know it sounds counterintuitive with all the deadlines, but I can't function like this. I need to aim for at least 6-7 hours, even if it means being strategic about what I can realistically get done.\n2.  **Strategic attack on deadlines:** Instead of just feeling overwhelmed, I need to break down each assignment into smaller, manageable chunks. I'll use my high conscientiousness to plan this out properly.\n3.  **Attempt class attendance:** Even if I'm tired, I need to try and make it to at least some of my classes. Being there, even if I'm just absorbing passively, is better than nothing.\n4.  **Find a moment for myself:** Whether it's a quick walk, listening to music, or just five minutes of quiet, I need to intentionally carve out some time for self-care to try and boost my happiness and stamina, even slightly.\n5.  **Reach out:** Maybe just a quick text to a friend, or a coffee break with someone. My social score is too low, and I know connecting with people helps.\n\nI know I have the knowledge, I just need to find a way to channel it without completely burning out.
