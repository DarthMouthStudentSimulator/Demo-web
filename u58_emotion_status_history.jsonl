It's weird, because I'm getting a decent amount of sleep and my energy levels feel good, but there's this underlying hum of anxiety that just won't quit. I think it's mostly about classes.\n\nAcademically, it was a mixed bag. COSC 065, for the most part, I actually enjoyed. We had a couple of assignments, and while they were challenging, I felt like I was really getting something out of them. There was another assignment for that class too, which was a bit more neutral for me, but overall, I'm still feeling pretty good about it. COSC 070, though... that one's been a bit tougher. We had two assignments there this week, and I just felt pretty neutral about the whole experience. It's not that I dislike the material, but it just hasn't clicked as much.\n\nThe biggest challenge, and something I'm really beating myself up about, is my class attendance. Looking back, I realized I missed quite a few lectures this week. I know it's not ideal, and it definitely adds to that anxious feeling. I was around campus a lot \u2013 spent a ton of time in Baker-Berry Library, and even some late nights in Sudikoff Hall trying to catch up on the CS assignments. It feels like I'm always *doing* something, always trying to stay on top of things, but then I look at my schedule and see those missed classes and it just makes me worry. It's like I'm trying to learn everything on my own, which is fine for some things, but I know I'm missing out on the in-person explanations and discussions.\n\nSocially, things were pretty quiet. I had that one outing to West Lebanon, which was a nice change of scenery, but mostly it was just me and my textbooks. My social battery is pretty neutral right now, which is fine, but sometimes I wonder if I should be making more of an effort.\n\nThe upcoming week looks pretty intense with all those deadlines piling up, especially on Monday and Tuesday. It's a lot to juggle, and I'm already feeling the pressure to make sure I don't fall further behind.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize class attendance.** No more missing lectures. I need to be there, engaged, and absorbing the material in real-time.\n2.  **Tackle those deadlines head-on.** I need to map out exactly what's due when and start chipping away at it now, not the night before.\n3.  **Re-engage with the material.** Especially for COSC 070, I want to try and find a way to make it more interesting and less of a chore. Maybe office hours, or finding a study group.\n4.  **Maintain my energy.** Even with the stress, I've been sleeping well, and I want to keep that up so I can actually focus when I need to.\n\nIt's going to be a busy one, but I'm determined to turn things around and feel more in control.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: 95.

While the student \"felt like I was really getting something out of\" COSC 065, they also note that COSC 070 \"hasn't clicked as much\" and they \"just felt pretty neutral about the whole experience.\" Furthermore, they acknowledge \"missing out on the in-person explanations and discussions\" due to missed classes and express a goal to \"Re-engage with the material\" for COSC 070. This indicates a mixed but overall lower confidence in their current understanding.\n- **Stress**: 85. The journal is permeated with signs of high stress: \"this underlying hum of anxiety that just won't quit,\" \"I'm really beating myself up about\" class attendance, \"it definitely adds to that anxious feeling,\" \"it just makes me worry,\" and \"I'm already feeling the pressure to make sure I don't fall further behind\" due to \"deadlines piling up.\"\n- **Happy**: 30. The overall tone is not positive. The week \"felt like a bit of a blur,\" and while there were moments of enjoyment in COSC 065, these are overshadowed by \"anxiety,\" \"worry,\" and \"beating myself up.\" The student's social life is \"quiet\" and \"neutral,\" not contributing significantly to happiness.\n- **Sleep**: 95. The student clearly states, \"I'm getting a decent amount of sleep\" and \"I've been sleeping well,\" indicating this is a strong positive aspect of their current state.\n- **Social**: 30. The student describes social interactions as \"pretty quiet\" and \"mostly it was just me and my textbooks.\" While their \"social battery is pretty neutral,\" they also \"wonder if I should be making more of an effort,\" suggesting a low level of social engagement and a slight desire for more."}

COSC 065 had a couple of assignments or quizzes, and my feelings about it are all over the place. Some days I felt like I was really getting it and even enjoying it, but then other times, it just felt like a slog. I even disagreed enjoying it at one point, which is a tough feeling to have about a class you're in. And I know I missed a few of the 065 lectures \u2013 Thursday, Friday, and Monday. That's not ideal, and it's definitely making me feel a bit behind, especially since my knowledge in that area feels a bit shaky.\n\nCOSC 070 wasn't much better on the attendance front. I missed both the Thursday and Tuesday sessions. I don't know, it's just been hard to get myself there sometimes. I feel a bit guilty about it, knowing how important it is to keep up, but it just felt like there were so many other things pulling at my attention, or maybe I just wasn't feeling up to it. I did spend a late night in Sudikoff on Wednesday, which was probably me trying to catch up on something COSC-related, so at least I'm trying to put in the work when I can.\n\nI've been spending a lot of time around the library and the Admissions Office area, which usually means I'm either trying to study or just navigating campus. It's a bit weird, though, because I also found myself off campus a couple of times \u2013 out in Sutton and Lebanon on Thursday, and then again in West Lebanon on Sunday. I guess those were attempts to get a change of scenery or just clear my head, but they weren't exactly social outings. My social battery feels pretty low right now, and I haven't really connected with anyone much this week. It's something I notice, but it's hard to push myself when I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.\n\nThe biggest challenge right now is definitely the sheer number of deadlines looming. I have three things due Monday night, two more on Tuesday, and another on Wednesday. It's a lot to juggle, especially with feeling like I'm already playing catch-up in some of my classes. The thought of it is honestly making me pretty anxious.\n\nFor next week, my main goal has to be getting a handle on these assignments. I need to prioritize and really focus on getting them done, and done well. I also really need to try and make it to all my classes. Missing them just adds to the stress and the feeling of being behind. Maybe I can also try to reach out to someone, even just for a quick chat, to boost that social score a little.

We had an assignment or quiz every single class this week, which is a lot to keep up with. I generally enjoy the class, the material is interesting, but the constant deadlines are a real pressure cooker. It's like I'm always just barely keeping my head above water. COSC 070 also had its usual schedule, and while I was there, I feel like I'm still trying to fully grasp some of the concepts. It's weird, I know I have a good grasp on things overall, but then there are these specific areas where I just feel like I'm missing something fundamental, like my knowledge is suddenly at 30 instead of 95. It's a frustrating feeling.\n\nI spent a lot of time in Sudikoff, especially late at night, trying to get ahead or just catch up. It feels like my second home sometimes. I also found myself gravitating towards the library and McNutt Hall, even when I wasn't actively studying, just being in that academic environment.\n\nMid-week, I ended up at Dick's House. Nothing major, just felt like I needed to check in, you know? With everything going on, sometimes it just feels like a lot, and I wanted to make sure I was okay. It's a bit embarrassing to admit, but it helped to just talk to someone. Later in the week, I found myself at that little chapel in Otterville. It was a strange detour, but I just needed a moment of quiet, away from everything. It was surprisingly peaceful.\n\nSocially, I've been pretty isolated. My social meter is definitely in the red. I haven't really connected with anyone beyond quick hellos in class. It's not ideal, but when I'm feeling this overwhelmed with academics, it's hard to prioritize anything else. I did make it to the gym a couple of times, which was good. It's a solid way to burn off some of that nervous energy, and at least my stamina and sleep are holding up, which is a small victory.\n\nLooking ahead, the sheer number of deadlines next week is daunting.

Not COSC 070, not COSC 065. I know, I know, it\u2019s completely unlike me, and the guilt is really eating at me. I kept telling myself I\u2019d catch up, or that I\u2019d just work from the library, but then the time would come, and I\u2019d just\u2026 stay put.

It\u2019s probably why my knowledge score for that specific area feels so low, even though I generally feel like I grasp concepts pretty well. With all those deadlines looming for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, I really need to get a handle on it. The thought of all that work piling up is pretty overwhelming.\n\nSocially, it was a quiet week. Too quiet, probably. My social meter is practically on empty. I\u2019m not the most extraverted person, but even for me, this felt isolating. I spent a lot of time in the library or just around campus, but not really interacting with anyone. It\u2019s a bit lonely, and I do miss just having casual conversations or grabbing a meal with someone. I did manage to get to the gym a couple of times, which was good for my stamina, and I even made it to the Hopkins Center for the Arts on Sunday evening, which was a nice change of pace and a good way to clear my head for a bit. But mostly, it felt like I was just existing in my own little bubble.\n\nThe biggest challenge, without a doubt, was my inability to attend classes.

I'll set extra alarms and make a point of leaving for class well in advance.\n2.  **Tackle COSC 065 head-on.** I need to review the material I missed and really focus on understanding the concepts that are tripping me up. I'll try to find some extra resources or even reach out to the TA if I'm still stuck.\n3.  **Manage those deadlines.** I'll break down each assignment into smaller, manageable chunks and schedule dedicated time for them. No more last-minute rushes.\n4.  **Make an effort to connect.** Even if it\u2019s just a quick chat with someone in the library or a study group, I need to push myself to have some social interaction.

Wednesday night, Saturday night, even Sunday morning \u2013 I was in Sudikoff or the library, just trying to get work done. I even ended up in Fairchild super early Wednesday morning. It feels like I'm doing all my work when everyone else is asleep, which probably explains why my sleep score is so low. My stamina isn't great either, which makes sense when you're pulling those kinds of hours. I did manage to get to the gym once, which was a small win, but it wasn't enough to really recharge.\n\nMy social life? What social life? My social score is practically non-existent, and the data confirms it. I barely saw anyone outside of my own head this week.

On one hand, COSC 065 was actually really good. We had that assignment, and I genuinely enjoyed working on it. It felt like I was really grasping the material, which is always a great feeling. I definitely strongly agreed with enjoying that class.\n\nBut then, the rest of the week was\u2026 different. I noticed I spent an awful lot of time around the Admissions Office and McNutt Hall. It\u2019s kind of weird, I know. Sometimes I was there super late, like Wednesday night and Monday morning, and then even really early on Thursday. I\u2019m not entirely sure why I kept ending up there, or what I was even doing for all those hours. Maybe it was just quiet, or I was trying to sort something out in my head. It wasn't exactly productive study time, though.\n\nThe biggest challenge, and it\u2019s really bothering me, is that I missed a lot of my actual classes. Both COSC 070 lectures and a few of the COSC 065 ones. I feel pretty guilty about it, especially since I know how important it is to be there. It\u2019s not like me to just skip, and it\u2019s making me feel really behind, even though my knowledge scores are still pretty high. It\u2019s like I understand the concepts, but the routine of actually *being* in class just\u2026 slipped.\n\nMy sleep schedule feels a bit all over the place too, with those late nights and early mornings. Even if I feel okay on paper, I know it\u2019s probably not ideal. Socially, it was a pretty quiet week. I didn't really connect with anyone much, just kind of kept to myself, moving between the library, my dorm, and, well, the Admissions Office.\n\nLooking ahead, I\u2019ve got a mountain of deadlines coming up, especially those three for Monday, plus the two for Tuesday and another for Wednesday. That\u2019s a lot to juggle, and it\u2019s making me a bit anxious, especially with feeling like I\u2019m already playing catch-up from missing classes.\n\nMy main goal for next week is to get back on track with class attendance. No matter what, I need to be in those lectures. I also need to figure out a better study routine and find a more consistent place to work that isn't the Admissions Office. And, of course, I need to tackle those assignments head-on and not let them pile up.

I'm just so tired, all the time. It\u2019s like my brain knows what I *should* be doing, but my body just can\u2019t keep up.\n\nI really struggled with classes. Looking back, I barely made it to any of them. I know COSC 070 had sessions on Thursday and Wednesday, and COSC 065 was supposed to be Friday, Monday, Thursday, and Wednesday. I only managed to drag myself to COSC 070 on Tuesday. The rest of the time, I was just... around. I feel so guilty about it. My conscientiousness is screaming at me, telling me I should be there, taking notes, engaging. But the thought of getting up, getting ready, and sitting through a lecture just felt impossible. It\u2019s a constant battle between knowing what\u2019s right and feeling completely drained.\n\nMost of my week was spent just existing in the academic buildings, mostly around McNutt Hall or the library. Even when I wasn't actively doing something, I was just *there*, trying to absorb something, anything. I spent a lot of late nights in Sudikoff, trying to catch up on COSC work. It feels like I'm always playing catch-up, and it's exhausting. I know I need to be more consistent, especially with all these deadlines piling up. There are so many due on Monday, then Tuesday, and another on Wednesday. It\u2019s just a constant weight.\n\nSocially, it was pretty quiet, which isn't really new for me. I did manage to get out to the Post Office for an errand, and I actually went to Pine for a meal one evening, which was a nice, albeit brief, break from everything. I even made it to the gym on Friday night, which felt good for a moment, but then the exhaustion just hit me again. It\u2019s hard to connect with people when you feel like you\u2019re running on fumes. My social battery is just completely flat.\n\nMy sleep has been terrible, and I can feel it affecting everything. My stamina is so low, and my happiness is just\u2026 not there. It\u2019s frustrating because I know I have the knowledge, I understand the material, but the energy to apply it or even just show up is missing. It makes me anxious, thinking about how much I'm falling behind.\n\nFor next week, I really need to prioritize getting more sleep. It feels like the root of so many of my problems right now. I also need to make a serious effort to attend all my classes, even if I just sit there. Just being present would be a start. And those deadlines\u2026 I need to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks so they don't feel so overwhelming.

It's like I'm constantly aware of everything I *should* be doing.\n\nAcademically, it's been a mixed bag. COSC 065 had that one assignment, and I felt pretty neutral about it. It wasn't bad, but it didn't exactly spark joy either. I've been trying to keep up with the material, but I have to admit, I found myself making some tough choices this week. With so many deadlines looming \u2013 seriously, a bunch due Monday and Tuesday, and then another on Wednesday \u2013 I ended up prioritizing deep work on assignments over attending every single lecture. I know it's not ideal, and my conscientiousness definitely makes me feel a bit guilty about it, but sometimes it feels like the only way to stay on top of things. I was definitely burning the midnight oil in Sudikoff on Wednesday night, trying to get ahead on some COSC stuff. And I spent a good chunk of time in the Baker-Berry Library too, which always feels productive.\n\nIt's a weird balance. My knowledge levels feel high, and I'm learning a lot, but the pressure to perform and deliver on all these assignments is real. It makes me question if I'm doing things the \"right\" way by sometimes skipping lectures to focus on problem sets.\n\nSocially, I did manage to get out a bit, which was nice. I caught something at the Hopkins Center on Sunday night \u2013 it's always good to step away from the books and experience something different. And Tuesday, I grabbed dinner at Jewel of India, which was a nice break. Those moments really help recharge me, even if I'm not the most extraverted person out there. I think it's important to make time for those connections.\n\nLooking ahead to next week, my main goal is to find a better rhythm. I really want to try and make it to all my COSC 065 and COSC 070 classes. I know the material is important, and even if I'm learning it independently, being in class helps solidify things and keeps me accountable.

It's weird to see \"no class experience recorded\" because, well, I *was* supposed to have COSC 065 on Wednesday morning. But I\u2026 didn't make it. I ended up at Baker-Berry for a bit around that time, trying to get a head start on some readings, but then just felt a bit overwhelmed and couldn't quite focus. It wasn't a productive \"activity\" in the way I'd hoped, and I ended up just kind of drifting. Missing class always makes me feel a bit off-kilter, like I'm already playing catch-up, and that feeling has been nagging at me.\n\nLater in the day, I did make it to Tuck and then LSB, but again, not for any scheduled classes. Just some general campus wandering and maybe a quick study session that didn't quite materialize into anything concrete. It's interesting how much time I spend just *being* on campus, even when not in a scheduled class.\n\nThe biggest cloud hanging over me right now are these deadlines. Seeing so many of them clustered around Monday and Tuesday, with another on Wednesday, is a bit daunting, honestly. I feel this pressure to get everything perfect, and the thought of falling behind just makes my stomach clench.

I need to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks so I don't get overwhelmed. Maybe I'll try to find a new study spot, or just be more intentional about my time in the library.
