It feels like it flew by, but also like I was stuck in a bit of a loop.\n\nLooking back, the biggest thing that jumps out at me is how much time I spent at the Boathouse. Seriously, it's almost embarrassing. I was scheduled for all my classes \u2013 COSC 089, MUS 016, COSC 065 \u2013 and I know exactly where they are, but for some reason, I just didn't make it to any of them. The \"no class experience recorded\" summary is painfully accurate, and it's a bit of a wake-up call to see it in black and white. It's not like I was actively avoiding them, but I just found myself gravitating towards the Boathouse, even during class times. It's a comfortable spot, I guess, but definitely not where I should be when I have lectures.\n\nI did try to be productive elsewhere. I was in LSC and Steele Hall on Thursday, and Fairchild on Friday evening, trying to get some work done. And I spent a fair bit of time in Sudikoff, especially Monday evening, which is good because that's where my COSC classes are. But even then, a lot of those hours were marked as \"no activity,\" which probably means I was there, but not really *doing* anything substantial. It's frustrating because I know I *should* be working, especially with all these deadlines piling up. There are so many things due on Monday and Wednesday next week, and a couple on Friday and Tuesday too. That's definitely a source of underlying stress.\n\nSocially, things felt pretty neutral. I had some \"activity\" at the Boathouse and grabbed food at the Class of 1953 Commons on Tuesday, so I wasn't completely isolated. My social meter is at 50, which feels about right \u2013 not super outgoing, but not completely withdrawn either.\n\nIt's weird, my sleep and stamina are both at 100, which is great, but it almost makes the lack of class attendance more puzzling. I'm not exhausted, so it's not a physical barrier. My happiness and knowledge are both at 50, which feels like a reflection of this week's academic limbo. I'm not unhappy, but I'm certainly not thriving academically right now. The challenge is definitely getting myself *to* class and then actually engaging once I'm there. It feels like there's a disconnect between knowing what I need to do and actually doing it.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Attend every single class.** No more Boathouse detours during lecture times. I need to be in Sudikoff, Hopkins, and LSB when I'm supposed to be.\n2.  **Tackle those deadlines head-on.** I need to break them down into smaller, manageable tasks and start chipping away at them immediately. Maybe I'll try to find a study buddy or go to office hours to get some momentum.\n3.  **Be more intentional with my time in academic buildings.** If I'm in Sudikoff, I need to be actively working on COSC assignments, not just sitting there.\n4.  **Figure out the Boathouse thing.** I need to understand why I'm drawn there during class hours. Is it a need for a break? A distraction? I need to find healthier ways to manage that impulse.\n\nI know I can turn this around. It's just a matter of getting back into a consistent routine and pushing through the initial inertia.

Physically, I\u2019m doing great \u2013 I\u2019ve been getting a ton of sleep, and my stamina is through the roof, which is a definite plus. But my happiness and social levels are just kind of hovering in the middle, not really soaring. I guess that makes sense when I look at what actually happened.\n\nThe biggest thing that stands out is my class attendance, or rather, the lack thereof. It seems I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week, which is a pretty big deal. I have COSC 089, MUS 016, and COSC 065, and I just\u2026 wasn't there. I did find myself at Sudikoff on Wednesday evening and LSB on Thursday afternoon, which are the buildings for my CS classes, so I must have been trying to work on something or catch up on material, but it wasn't during the actual lecture times. And I was at the Hopkins Center on Saturday night, which is where my music class is, so maybe I caught a performance or was just exploring. But the actual class experience? Zero. It\u2019s a bit unsettling to realize I just kind of\u2026 opted out, even if unconsciously.\n\nMost of my time was spent at the Boathouse, which is pretty much my home base. It feels a little isolating when I think about it. There were a few moments of activity, like that late-night burst on Sunday, but mostly it was just being in my own space. I\u2019m not sure why I wasn\u2019t motivated to go to class. Was I just lost in thought, exploring ideas on my own, or was there something else holding me back? It\u2019s something I need to really dig into. My knowledge levels are okay, but I know this isn't a sustainable path for actually learning and growing.\n\nAnd then there are the deadlines. So many of them! Multiple things due on Monday, Wednesday, plus a few on Friday and Tuesday. It\u2019s a lot to keep track of, and the thought of all that work piling up, especially after missing classes, is definitely creating a low hum of anxiety. My conscientiousness is kicking in, telling me I need to get on top of this, but the sheer volume feels a bit overwhelming right now.\n\nSo, for next week, my goals are pretty clear and straightforward:\n1.  **Prioritize class attendance.** I absolutely need to be in those lectures for COSC 089, MUS 016, and COSC 065. No more missing out.\n2.  **Tackle the upcoming deadlines.** I need to sit down, map out everything that\u2019s due, and start working through it systematically. I have the stamina, so I need to channel that energy into productive work.\n3.  **Actively seek out social interaction.** My social meter is at 50, and I know I thrive when I\u2019m connecting with people. I need to make an effort to get out of the Boathouse more, maybe grab meals with friends or join a study group.\n\nThis past week felt like a quiet pause, a time for internal processing.

I did have a few bursts of activity. I was at the Life Sciences Center on Wednesday afternoon, and then Hopkins on Thursday, and McNutt on Friday. None of those were for my scheduled classes, though. It felt more like I was just moving around campus, maybe running errands or just trying to get a change of scenery.\n\nThe real work, or at least the focused activity, seemed to happen later in the week and mostly at night. Sunday evening, I was at Fairchild, and then again late Monday and Tuesday nights at Sudikoff. That was definitely me trying to get a handle on the COSC assignments. It feels like I'm constantly playing catch-up, especially with all those deadlines looming. There are so many due on Monday, and then more on Friday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It\u2019s a lot to keep track of, and it makes me feel a bit overwhelmed, which probably contributes to the whole \"not going to class\" thing.

I wasn't really out and about connecting with people much, just kind of in my own head, dealing with the academic pressure.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was definitely my attendance, or lack thereof. It\u2019s frustrating because I *want* to be engaged, and I know the material is important, especially for COSC. My knowledge level is still decent, but I can feel it slipping if I don't actively participate.

That's a pretty big miss, and it's something I really need to address. It\u2019s not ideal, I know. I think that's part of why I'm feeling a bit low on the happiness scale right now. There's this underlying hum of guilt, I guess.\n\nDespite missing classes, I was definitely active. The Boathouse seems to be my second home, or maybe even my first this week. I was there constantly, day and night, sometimes doing things, sometimes just\u2026 being. It\u2019s a comfortable spot, but maybe a little *too* comfortable, pulling me away from other responsibilities. I also spent a good chunk of time in Sudikoff Hall, which is where I actually felt productive. I was there late Wednesday, Friday, Monday, and Tuesday, really diving into some of the COSC material. It\u2019s weird, I feel like I\u2019m learning a lot and my knowledge is still pretty high, but it\u2019s all self-driven, not from lectures. It makes me wonder if I'm just learning in a different way, or if I'm just avoiding the structured environment. Probably a bit of both.\n\nBeyond the Boathouse and Sudikoff, I managed to get to the gym on Thursday, which felt good. And there were a few random trips to places like McNutt Hall, Fairchild, and the Admissions Office \u2013 just bits and pieces of campus life. My social life feels\u2026 okay. The Boathouse is probably where most of that happens, even if it\u2019s not explicitly recorded as \"social activity.\" I'm not feeling completely isolated, but it's not like I'm out and about constantly either.\n\nPhysically, I'm doing great. My sleep is through the roof, which is awesome, and my stamina is high. So, it's not a lack of energy that's holding me back. It's more of a mental block, I think. The happiness being so low is a clear sign. There are so many deadlines looming \u2013 a bunch on Monday, some on Friday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It feels like a lot, and maybe that's contributing to the avoidance. I know I *should* be in class, but sometimes it feels easier to just tackle the assignments on my own time, even if it means missing out on the lecture content.\n\nFor next week, my biggest goal is to actually *attend* my classes. Seriously. I need to break this cycle. I'm going to set alarms and make a conscious effort to be in Sudikoff and Hopkins when I'm supposed to be. I also need to get a handle on these deadlines. I'm going to map them out and dedicate specific blocks of time to each one, especially those Monday ones. I want to feel that sense of accomplishment, not just the anxiety of things piling up.

The biggest thing, the one that's really gnawing at me, is that I didn't make it to a single class. Not one. COSC 089, MUS 016, COSC 065 \u2013 all of them, just... missed. It's so unlike me, and it makes me feel incredibly guilty and frustrated. I mean, my knowledge scores are still pretty high, so it's not like I'm completely lost on the material, but just *being there* is half the battle, right? And I lost that battle every day.\n\nWhat's weird is that I've been sleeping a ton. My sleep stat is 100, which is great, I guess? I spent so much time at the Boathouse, just... being there. It feels like I was physically present, but mentally, I was just checked out. It's a strange paradox \u2013 I'm getting all this rest, my stamina is high, but I just couldn't seem to muster the energy or motivation to get myself to class. It's like there's this invisible wall between me and the lecture halls. I keep asking myself why, and I don't really have a good answer. Is it just a slump? Am I overwhelmed? I don't know.\n\nI did manage to pull myself together for some other things. I spent a good chunk of time in Sudikoff on Wednesday, Friday, and Monday evenings, which means I was at least trying to keep up with the COSC assignments. That's a small win, I suppose, especially with all these deadlines looming. Seriously, it feels like every other day there's something due, mostly Mondays and Wednesdays. That pressure is definitely not helping my mood.\n\nBeyond that, my activity was pretty sparse. I made it to the dining hall a couple of times, which is always good for a quick refuel, but my social score is just average. I haven't really had any deep conversations or hung out with friends much. It feels a bit isolating, actually. I also found myself at Hopkins and McNutt Hall a few times, but not for anything specific, just kind of wandering, I guess. It's like I was trying to engage with campus life, but couldn't quite connect.\n\nThis low happiness is really getting to me.

I know I'm capable, and I know I *want* to do well, but there's this inertia that's hard to shake.\n\nFor next week, my absolute top priority has to be getting to class. No excuses. I need to break this cycle. I'm going to set multiple alarms, maybe even ask a friend to drag me out of bed if I have to. I also need to be more proactive about those deadlines. Instead of just working on them when I feel like it, I need to schedule dedicated time. And maybe, just maybe, I need to reach out to someone. A friend, an advisor, anyone.

It\u2019s a place where I can just *be*.\n\nI did manage to get out a bit, though. I was at McNutt and the Admissions Office on Wednesday, and I even popped into the Hood Museum. On Thursday, I made it to Baker-Berry Library, which was good, at least I was in an academic space. Friday, I had some kind of activity at Reed Hall, which wasn't a class, but it was something. And then Monday night, I was at Sudikoff, actually doing something productive, probably working on a COSC assignment given the deadlines. Tuesday afternoon, I was at Hopkins, which is interesting since I missed my MUS 016 class there earlier in the day. Maybe it was a rehearsal or something else related to music, but not the actual class.\n\nMy social life feels pretty quiet. Being at the Boathouse so much probably contributes to that.

But then there\u2019s my happiness, which is just\u2026 ten. That\u2019s really low. And my social score is barely hanging on. It makes me wonder what\u2019s going on.\n\nThe biggest thing that jumps out, and it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to admit, is that I didn't actually make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. The system says \"no class experience recorded,\" and yeah, that's accurate. I had COSC 089, MUS 016, and COSC 065 on the schedule, but I just\u2026 didn't go. It\u2019s not like I was completely checked out, though. I spent a good chunk of time in Sudikoff, especially on Wednesday afternoon and Monday and Tuesday evenings. I was definitely working on COSC stuff, just not during the lecture times. Same with Hopkins \u2013 I was there Wednesday evening and Tuesday afternoon, and again on Sunday, which makes me think I was probably practicing or working on something for MUS 016, even though I missed the actual class. And that late-night session in Fairchild on Saturday into Sunday morning? Definitely grinding on something. So, I was engaged with the material, just not in the way I'm supposed to be. It feels a bit like I'm trying to learn everything on my own terms, which is probably why my knowledge score is still high, but it's clearly not making me happy.\n\nMy social life has been pretty non-existent, too. That 30 score feels about right. I was at Parker House for a bit on Saturday, which was nice, but beyond that, it\u2019s been a lot of solo time. I spend a surprising amount of time at the Boathouse, which is kind of my default spot, whether I'm just chilling or trying to focus. It\u2019s comfortable, but maybe a little too comfortable, keeping me from engaging with others.\n\nThe upcoming deadlines are definitely weighing on me. There are so many of them, especially a bunch due on Monday, and then more on Friday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It feels like a constant stream, and missing classes probably isn't helping me stay on top of the specific assignments or understanding what's expected. I feel like I know the concepts, but the practical application and keeping up with the pace of the courses is where I'm falling short.\n\nSo, for next week, I really need to turn this around. My main goal, unequivocally, is to *attend my classes*. All of them. I need to be present, engage with the professors, and get back into the rhythm of structured learning. It\u2019s clearly not working for me to just self-study everything, even if I feel like I'm grasping the concepts. Second, I need to make a conscious effort to boost my social score. Maybe grab a meal with someone, or join a study group. Just something to connect with people. I think that\u2019s a big part of why my happiness is so low. And finally, I need to get a better handle on these deadlines. I'll map them out and try to tackle them proactively, rather than letting them pile up.

It feels like a bit of a blur, honestly. My head's still spinning from all the early mornings and late nights.\n\nLooking at the schedule, it's clear I didn't make it to many of my actual classes this week. The system says \"no class experience recorded,\" and yeah, that's pretty accurate. COSC 089, MUS 016, COSC 065 \u2013 I know they're there, I know I *should* be there. But the Boathouse just\u2026 it calls to me. It's where I spend pretty much all my time, whether it's for actual practice or just being around the team. Those \"Activity: Yes\" moments at the Boathouse, like the 5 AM on Monday or the evening session on Wednesday, really sum up where my focus has been. It's intense, but I genuinely love it. It's probably why my happy and stamina levels are still so high. There's something incredibly fulfilling about pushing myself like that.\n\nI did make it to Hopkins on Tuesday afternoon, and Sudikoff a few times, but it wasn't for my scheduled classes. I was there later in the day, probably trying to catch up on some readings or work on a problem set. It's a bit of a scramble, trying to absorb everything when you're not in the lectures. My knowledge score is still pretty high, which is a relief, but I know I'm relying a lot on self-study and maybe some notes from friends. It's not ideal, and I can feel the pressure building.\n\nSpeaking of pressure, those deadlines are starting to pile up. So many Mondays and Wednesdays! It's a bit daunting, especially knowing how much class time I've missed. That's definitely where the neurotic side of me kicks in \u2013 a low hum of anxiety about getting everything done and done well.\n\nMy social score is pretty low, which is something I've noticed. Even though I'm constantly surrounded by people at the Boathouse, it's a very specific kind of interaction. It's team-focused, goal-oriented. I haven't really had much time for just hanging out, grabbing coffee, or having those casual conversations that make you feel connected outside of the sport. I'm generally an extraverted person, so that lack of broader social interaction is starting to feel a bit isolating, even if I'm happy with my rowing.\n\n**Challenges this week:**\nThe biggest challenge is clearly the class attendance. It's a direct consequence of my commitment to rowing, and while I don't regret the time spent on the water, I know I can't keep missing so much. The looming deadlines are also a significant source of stress. And honestly, finding time for a social life beyond the Boathouse bubble.\n\n**Goals for next week:**\n1.  **Prioritize Class Attendance:** I need to make a conscious effort to be in those lectures, especially with so many deadlines coming up. I need to figure out how to manage my mornings better.\n2.  **Tackle Deadlines Head-On:** I'm going to map out all those assignments and start chipping away at them early. No more last-minute scrambles.\n3.  **Seek Out Social Time:** Even if it's just an hour, I want to try and connect with friends outside of practice. Maybe a quick meal or a study session that turns into a chat.\n4.  **Maintain Balance:** Keep up the intensity at the Boathouse, because it's good for me, but find a way to integrate my academic responsibilities more effectively. I'm happy and energetic, I just need to channel that energy into all areas of my life.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina**: Set to 90 because the student explicitly states, \"It's probably why my happy and stamina levels are still so high\" and \"I'm happy and energetic.\" While they mention \"My head's still spinning from all the early mornings and late nights,\" this seems to reflect the intense pace and blur of the week rather than a lack of physical energy for their chosen activities, which they find \"incredibly fulfilling.\"\n-   **Knowledge**: Set to 80 because the student directly says, \"My knowledge score is still pretty high, which is a relief.\" However, they also acknowledge it's \"a bit of a scramble, trying to absorb everything when you're not in the lectures\" and that they are \"relying a lot on self-study and maybe some notes from friends,\" indicating it's high but precarious.\n-   **Stress**: Set to 95 due to multiple strong indicators: \"I can feel the pressure building,\" \"those deadlines are starting to pile up.

It feels like a bit of a whirlwind, honestly, but I'm actually feeling pretty good overall. My happiness is still surprisingly high, which is a relief, especially with everything that's been going on.\n\nClasses this week\u2026 that\u2019s definitely something I need to address. I didn't make it to any of my scheduled lectures. Not COSC 089, not MUS 016, and not COSC 065. I know it\u2019s not ideal, and it feels a bit strange to admit, but I think I just got completely absorbed in my assignments. There are so many deadlines piling up, especially those coming up on Monday, and I just felt like I needed to be heads-down, deep in the code or working through problems. I spent a lot of time in Sudikoff, especially late into Wednesday and Friday evenings, and even pulled an all-nighter into Sunday morning. It feels like I'm learning a ton through all that focused work \u2013 my knowledge stats are still looking good, so I guess the self-study is paying off in that regard. But it\u2019s definitely not the traditional way to keep up.\n\nThe downside of all that late-night work is my sleep. It\u2019s pretty low, and I can definitely feel the effects. My stamina is surprisingly holding up, which is a blessing, but I know this isn't sustainable long-term. I also spent a lot of time at the Boathouse, which is usually where I go to just\u2026 exist, I guess. It\u2019s peaceful there, but I wasn't really *doing* anything specific, just trying to recharge or zone out.\n\nSocially, I'm still feeling a bit isolated. My social score is pretty low, and looking back, I didn't really make time for much beyond my work. I was at Maynard Street a couple of times, which is student housing, so maybe I saw people around, but nothing really stands out as a dedicated social interaction. I did manage to hit the gym at Leverone Field House on Thursday, which was good for getting some energy out. And I spent some time at Tuck, which is a nice change of scenery for studying. I also found myself in a classroom at Reed Hall on Tuesday afternoon, which was a good spot to focus, even if it wasn't for a scheduled class.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely balancing everything. I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up with assignments, which then makes me skip classes, which then makes me feel like I need to work even harder to understand the material on my own. It\u2019s a bit of a cycle. And the sleep deprivation is starting to catch up, even if my stamina is holding for now.\n\nFor next week, I really need to prioritize getting to my classes. I'm missing out on the in-person explanations and discussions, and while I can learn on my own, it's just not the same. I also desperately need to figure out a better sleep schedule. Maybe if I start assignments earlier, I won't have to pull such late nights. And I should really try to connect with people more. Even just a quick coffee or a meal with someone. It\u2019s easy to get lost in the work, but I know I thrive when I have a bit more balance.

I was supposed to be in Sudikoff, Hopkins, LSB... but I just wasn't there.\n\nMost of my time, especially the inactive stretches, seems to have been spent at the Boathouse. I guess that's where I was trying to catch up on sleep, or just\u2026 exist. It\u2019s a peaceful spot, but clearly not conducive to attending lectures. I did manage to get some activity in there on Friday evening, which was nice, a good way to unwind a bit.
