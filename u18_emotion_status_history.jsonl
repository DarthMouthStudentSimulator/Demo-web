CHIN, COSC 065, COSC 089, TUCK... I was supposed to be in Reed, LSB, Sudikoff, Carson, and I just... wasn't. Or if I was in the building, it was at the wrong time, or I wasn't actually engaged. Like, I was at Reed on Wednesday and Thursday, but way after my Chinese class. And I was at LSB on Monday, but again, not for COSC 065. It's like I was orbiting around where I *should* be, but never quite landing. I even ended up at Sudikoff super early Friday morning, which makes no sense for a class. I don't know what I was doing there.\n\nMost of my time was spent in Parker House, which is just my dorm. It feels like I was hiding away, even though I know I shouldn't be. I did get out a bit \u2013 spent some time at the Boathouse, which is always a good escape, and even got some activity in there on Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday. I also found myself at the Admissions Office a couple of times, and visited Bartlett Hall. So I wasn't completely holed up, but it wasn't for productive academic reasons.\n\nThe weirdest part is, I'm not even physically tired. My sleep and stamina are actually pretty good. But mentally? It's a mess. There's this constant hum of anxiety, especially with all these deadlines piling up. I've got so many things due on Monday and Friday, and even some on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Knowing I've missed a whole week of lectures just makes that knot in my stomach tighter. I feel this immense pressure to catch up, but it's almost paralyzing.\n\nI really need to get a grip.

Like I was moving through thick mud, even when I wasn't actually moving at all. My schedule was packed with classes, but looking back, it\u2019s clear I barely made it to any of them. I saw the \"No class experience recorded this week\" summary, and honestly, it just confirmed what I already knew, but it still hit hard.\n\nWednesday started the pattern. I had CHIN 033, COSC 065, and COSC 089 all lined up, but I just couldn't get myself out of Parker House. It felt like a physical weight keeping me in bed. I know I *should* have been in Reed, then LSB, then Sudikoff, but the thought of facing everyone, of being behind, it just paralyzed me. I did manage to get out later, heading to LSB and then Sudikoff in the afternoon, trying to make up for lost time, I guess. I was there pretty late too, until 2 or 3 AM, just trying to get some COSC work done. It\u2019s a constant battle between knowing what I need to do and actually being able to do it.\n\nThursday was even worse. Another full day of classes missed \u2013 CHIN 033, COSC 065, TUCK 003. I spent almost the entire day cooped up in my dorm. I felt this immense pressure, but it just made me want to hide more. I did get out to the Boathouse for a bit in the late afternoon, just to get some air, but it wasn't for anything specific, just needed to clear my head.\n\nFriday, same story. Missed all my morning classes again. CHIN 033, COSC 065, COSC 089. It\u2019s like a broken record. I was in Parker House all morning. I did make it to LSB in the afternoon, and then the Boathouse again, but it felt more like I was just drifting, not really accomplishing anything.\n\nThe weekend was mostly spent in the dorm too, except for a few hours at Sudikoff on Saturday afternoon. I was trying to chip away at some assignments, but it felt like I was just treading water.\n\nAnd then Monday, the cycle repeated. Missed CHIN 033, COSC 065, COSC 089. I was in Parker House for most of the day, except for a brief trip to Reed and LSB in the early afternoon. I don't even know what I was doing there, just wandering, I think. The early morning trip to the Boathouse on Monday was weird, I just couldn't sleep, even though my sleep tracker says I'm getting plenty. It's like my body is rested, but my mind is just racing.\n\nTuesday was the absolute worst. I didn't leave Parker House until late at night. Missed CHIN 033, COSC 089, TUCK 003. All of them. I just couldn't face it. I ended up at Sudikoff again really late, working until 3 AM. It\u2019s this awful loop: I get anxious about falling behind, which makes me not want to go to class, which makes me fall further behind, which makes me even more anxious.\n\nMy happiness is at an all-time low. I feel so isolated. My social score is abysmal, and it's my own fault, I know. I'm not reaching out, and I'm not showing up. It's hard to connect with people when you're constantly feeling like you're failing. The sheer number of deadlines coming up \u2013 so many on Monday and Friday, plus a few on Tuesday and Wednesday \u2013 it\u2019s just overwhelming. I feel like I have all this knowledge, but I can't seem to apply it or even get myself to the places where I'm supposed to be learning more.\n\nMy biggest challenge right now is just getting out of my dorm and into class. It feels like such a simple thing, but it's become this huge hurdle. I'm worried about what my professors think, and I'm worried about how much I'm missing.\n\nFor next week, my goals are simple, but they feel monumental.\n1.  **Attend every single class.** No excuses. I need to break this cycle. Even if I just sit there, I need to be present.\n2.  **Prioritize the upcoming deadlines.** I need to make a concrete plan for each of those assignments, especially the COSC ones. The late nights at Sudikoff aren't sustainable if I'm not even going to class during the day.\n3.  **Try to engage, even a little.** Maybe ask one question in class, or just say hi to someone. My social life is non-existent, and while I don't feel like being a social butterfly, I need to at least try to feel less like a hermit.\n4.  **Find a way to manage this anxiety.** It's crippling. I'm sleeping a lot, and I have stamina, but it's not translating into mental well-being. I need to figure out how to stop this spiral.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina**: The student describes feeling \"heavy\" and \"moving through thick mud,\" indicating a profound lack of energy and motivation to act. They explicitly state, \"I just couldn't get myself out of Parker House.

However, they immediately follow this by saying, \"but I can't seem to apply it or even get myself to the places where I'm supposed to be learning more,\" suggesting a functional barrier to utilizing or expanding their knowledge, rather than a lack of foundational understanding.\n-   **Stress**: The student uses strong language to describe their stress, stating they were \"paralyzed\" by the thought of being behind and felt \"immense pressure.\" They explicitly mention an \"awful loop\" of anxiety and being \"overwhelmed\" by deadlines. Most critically, they describe their anxiety as \"crippling,\" indicating an extremely high and debilitating level of stress.\n-   **Happy**: The student directly states, \"My happiness is at an all-time low.\" This is further supported by feelings of isolation and the difficulty of connecting with others due to \"constantly feeling like you're failing,\" all contributing to a profoundly unhappy state.\n-   **Sleep**: The student explicitly states, \"my sleep tracker says I'm getting plenty\" and \"I'm sleeping a lot.\" While they note that this sleep isn't translating into mental well-being (\"my mind is just racing\"), the quantity of sleep itself appears to be high and sufficient according to their own report and tracker.\n-   **Social**: The student directly states, \"I feel so isolated\" and that \"My social score is abysmal.\" They further emphasize this by saying \"My social life is non-existent\" and expressing a need to \"feel less like a hermit,\" clearly indicating a very low level of social connection and satisfaction."}

Every morning, the thought of getting up and facing another lecture felt like climbing a mountain. I\u2019d just stay in Parker House, even though I knew I should be in Reed or Sudikoff. The guilt is really eating at me, especially with all these deadlines piling up. It\u2019s like I know exactly what I *should* be doing, but I just can\u2019t *do* it. My conscientiousness is screaming at me, but my body just won't cooperate.\n\nI did manage to get out sometimes, though. I was at Reed Hall a few times in the afternoons, and even the Life Sciences Center. Not for my actual classes, just\u2026 being there. Trying to study, I guess, or at least feel like I was being productive. And I was at Sudikoff late one night, trying to get some COSC work done. It feels like I'm constantly trying to catch up, but I'm just digging myself deeper.\n\nThe weirdest thing was going to the Admissions Office twice. I don't even know why, really.

It\u2019s Sunday night now, and I\u2019m just\u2026 exhausted. My happiness is at a 5, and yeah, that feels about right. My stamina is also shot. It\u2019s like I\u2019m constantly running on fumes, even though the sleep tracker says I\u2019m getting decent hours when I actually crash. I guess it\u2019s the quality, or maybe just the sheer mental load.\n\nThe biggest thing, and it\u2019s hard to even write this down, is that I didn't make it to a single one of my scheduled classes this week. Not one. CHIN 033, COSC 089, COSC 065, TUCK 003 \u2013 I missed them all. Every time the alarm went off, or I looked at the clock, the thought of getting up, getting ready, and facing another lecture just felt impossible. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to learn, my knowledge score is still high, but the *act* of going\u2026 it just felt like too much.\n\nInstead, I spent most of my time either holed up in Parker House or, more often, practically living in Sudikoff. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, I was mostly in my dorm, just trying to process things, I guess. But then the panic about all the deadlines started to set in. There are so many of them, especially for Monday and Friday. It\u2019s like a never-ending wave.\n\nSo, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I was basically glued to Sudikoff. I pulled some serious late nights there, trying to catch up on COSC assignments. I was there until 2 AM on Sunday, and then again until 7 AM on Tuesday morning. It\u2019s a desperate attempt to stay afloat, but it feels like I\u2019m just treading water. I know I *should* have been in class, learning the material properly, but I was so deep in trying to finish the previous week\u2019s work that I couldn\u2019t even think about new content. It\u2019s a vicious cycle.\n\nI did manage to get out a few times. I was at Reed Hall on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons, and again on Tuesday afternoon. Not for my scheduled Chinese class, but I was in a classroom, so maybe I was trying to get some work done there, or maybe I just needed a change of scenery. I also went to the Admissions Office on Wednesday, which was\u2026 something. And I made it to the Boathouse a couple of times, and Leverone Field House once. Those moments were brief breaks, but they didn't really alleviate the underlying stress. I even made it to the library on Thursday night, which felt like a small victory, but then it was back to the grind.\n\nMy social life is basically non-existent right now, which isn't helping my mood. My social score is an 8, and I feel it. I barely saw anyone outside of the occasional nod in the dorm or a quick trip to the dining hall on Friday night. It\u2019s isolating, and that just makes the anxiety worse. I know I need to connect with people, but when I\u2019m this overwhelmed, it feels like another task I can\u2019t manage.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely this feeling of being perpetually behind. The deadlines are piling up, and I\u2019m just trying to survive each one. It\u2019s hard to feel happy or energetic when every waking moment is dominated by the thought of what I *haven't* done yet.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear, even if they feel daunting.\n1.  **Attend every single class.** I *have* to break this cycle of missing lectures. I need to be there, even if I feel behind. Just showing up is a start.\n2.  **Prioritize.** I need to figure out a way to tackle these assignments without pulling all-nighters every other day. Maybe breaking them down into smaller chunks, or asking for help.\n3.  **Reach out.** Even if it\u2019s just a quick coffee with someone, I need to try and get some social interaction. Being alone with my thoughts and the workload is just making everything worse.\n4.  **Manage the anxiety.** I don't know how yet, but I need to find a way to cope with the overwhelming feeling. Maybe a walk, or just five minutes of quiet. Anything to stop the spiral.\n\nThis week was rough.

My energy levels are just completely shot, which is probably why I'm feeling so down. It's hard to feel happy when every movement feels like a monumental effort. I'm sleeping a lot, which is good, but it doesn't seem to be making a dent in how utterly exhausted I feel.\n\nThe biggest thing weighing on me is that I didn't make it to any of my classes this week. Not a single one. I know I should have been in CHIN 033, COSC 065, COSC 089, and TUCK 003, but I just couldn't bring myself to go. The guilt is immense, and it's just adding to the anxiety that's already bubbling under the surface. I was at the dorm for most of the time, just... existing. I did manage to be active for a couple of hours on Tuesday night, but even that felt like a struggle. I even ended up at Sudikoff late Tuesday, but I wasn't really *doing* anything. It's like my body is moving, but my brain isn't engaged.\n\nIt's frustrating because I feel like I *know* the material, or at least I have a good grasp on things generally, but missing class just makes me feel like I'm falling behind anyway. The thought of all those upcoming deadlines \u2013 there are so many, scattered across every day of the week \u2013 is just paralyzing. It feels like a mountain I can't even begin to climb when I'm this drained.\n\nSocially, I haven't really connected with anyone much either. When I'm feeling this low and tired, it's hard to put myself out there. I just want to curl up and disappear.\n\nMy biggest challenge right now is definitely getting myself back on track with classes and finding some way to boost my stamina. This exhaustion is making everything so much harder than it needs to be.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear, even if they feel daunting:\n1.  **Attend every single class.** No excuses. I need to be there, even if I just sit and listen.\n2.  **Start tackling those deadlines.** I need to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks so they don't feel so overwhelming. I'll pick one or two to focus on first.\n3.  **Figure out this stamina issue.** Maybe it's not just about sleep, but about what I'm doing when I'm awake. I need to find a way to feel less drained.\n4.  **Try to engage more.** Even if it's just a quick chat with someone, I need to try and push past this isolation.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina**: The student explicitly states, \"My energy levels are just completely shot,\" and \"every movement feels like a monumental effort,\" indicating extremely low physical and mental energy.

I\u2019m just so\u2026 drained. My happiness is practically non-existent, and my stamina is in the single digits. It\u2019s a miracle I even managed to drag myself out of bed most days, let alone actually *do* anything.\n\nClasses this week were a complete write-off. Every single one. CHIN 033, COSC 065, COSC 089, TUCK 003 \u2013 I missed them all. I don't even know how that happened. One minute it's morning, and I'm just... stuck. The thought of getting up, getting ready, walking to class, it just feels insurmountable. I know I *should* be there, I *want* to be there, but it's like there's this invisible wall. The guilt is eating at me, especially with all those deadlines piling up. So many Mon and Fri deadlines, it's just a constant pressure. I keep telling myself I'll catch up, but then the day just slips away.\n\nI spent most of the week holed up in Parker House. It\u2019s embarrassing, really. Just hours and hours of nothing. I barely left my room. I think I made it to Reed Hall a couple of times on Wednesday and Thursday, but it wasn't for class, just... being there, I guess? And Fairchild too. I don't even remember what I was doing. It\u2019s all a blur.\n\nThe only times I really felt like I was *doing* something were those late-night trips to the boathouse. It\u2019s weird, I know, but it\u2019s quiet there. Just the water and the dark. It\u2019s a strange kind of peace, a break from the constant hum of anxiety in my head. I also had a long stretch in Sudikoff on Sunday, which was probably me trying to cram some COSC stuff, but even then, it felt like I was just staring at the screen, not really absorbing anything. My knowledge for one COSC class is still high, which is a small comfort, but the other one\u2026 not so much.\n\nMy social life is non-existent, which isn't helping. I feel so isolated. It\u2019s hard to reach out when you feel like this, and honestly, I don't even have the energy to pretend to be okay. I just want to disappear sometimes.\n\nThis high level of neuroticism is really getting to me. I'm constantly on edge, worried about everything I'm not doing, which then makes me even less capable of doing it. It's a vicious cycle. I know I'm supposed to be conscientious, and I *am* trying, but it's like my body and mind just aren't cooperating.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to do better. I need to break this cycle. My goals are simple, but feel monumental:\n1.  Actually attend my classes. Just one, to start. Maybe CHIN 033 on Monday.\n2.  Get out of the dorm more, even if it's just to the library or a different building.\n3.  Try to tackle at least one of those looming deadlines head-on, instead of just letting them hang over me.\n4.  And maybe, just maybe, try to get some proper rest, not just lying in bed feeling miserable.\n\nIt feels like a lot, but I have to try.

It's not that I don't want to go, it's just... I don't know. Getting out of bed feels impossible sometimes, especially when I've been up so late. I spent most of Wednesday, Friday, and a good chunk of the weekend just holed up in my dorm. It feels like a safe space, but also a trap.\n\nThe late nights in Sudikoff were brutal. Thursday night, then again Saturday night into Sunday morning. It was just me and the hum of the computers, trying to get through COSC assignments. I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up, and even when I put in those hours, it feels like it's never enough. My brain just feels fried. No wonder my sleep is so messed up. I'm barely getting any, and it's definitely showing in how I feel.\n\nI barely saw anyone this week. My social battery is completely dead, and honestly, my happiness levels are in the gutter too.

I need to break this cycle of missing lectures and then trying to teach myself everything at 2 AM. I also need to figure out a way to get more sleep. Maybe if I start assignments earlier, I won't have to pull those all-nighters. And I really need to try and connect with someone, even just for a few minutes.

And I absolutely need to start chipping away at those deadlines, not just let them loom over me. Maybe I should try to find a study buddy or just talk to someone about how overwhelmed I feel.
