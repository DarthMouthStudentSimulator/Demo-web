It\u2019s funny, looking back, how some weeks just fly by, packed with so much, even if it\u2019s not always what you planned. My sleep and stamina are through the roof, which is great, but I can definitely feel the pressure building up, especially with all these deadlines looming.\n\nAcademically, I have to admit, this wasn't my strongest week. I somehow managed to miss all my scheduled classes \u2013 ENGS 069, ENGS 022, and ANTH 012. It\u2019s not ideal, and I know I need to get back on track. My conscientiousness is really kicking in here, making me feel a bit guilty about it. It wasn't intentional neglect, though. My head was just so deep into boathouse activities.\n\nThe boathouse has been my second home. I was there practically every day, sometimes for hours, really pushing myself. There were those intense sessions on Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and again on Tuesday evening, and even a late-night one early Wednesday morning. It\u2019s such a demanding but rewarding activity, and I love the feeling of pushing my limits. It definitely explains why my stamina is so high! I also managed to squeeze in some time at the Life Sciences Center on Wednesday and Friday afternoons, which was good for a change of pace, and a couple of late nights at Sudikoff Hall on Sunday, trying to get some work done.\n\nBeyond the boathouse, I tried to keep things balanced. My openness definitely led me to explore a bit. I spent a good chunk of time at the Hopkins Center for the Arts on Thursday, Friday, and Monday evenings. I love soaking in the creative atmosphere there, even if I wasn't actively participating in anything specific. And Thursday night, I even popped into the Hood Museum \u2013 it\u2019s always inspiring to see what\u2019s on display. The highlight of my weekend, though, was definitely heading off campus to the Davidson Pottery Studio on Saturday night. It was such a unique experience, completely different from anything else I do, and it was great to just get my hands dirty and create something.\n\nI also found myself at the Admissions Office a couple of times, which is a bit random. I think it was just me being curious and maybe seeing if there were any opportunities to help out or learn more about what they do. My extraversion and agreeableness probably make me gravitate towards those kinds of interactions.\n\nMy social life feels okay, sitting at a moderate 50. The boathouse is definitely where I get most of my social interaction, being part of a team. It\u2019s a tight-knit group, and we push each other, which is great. Happiness is also at 50, which feels about right. I\u2019m not unhappy, but the academic side of things is definitely a source of underlying stress, especially with so many deadlines piling up.\n\nSpeaking of which, the upcoming week is going to be intense. I have a mountain of deadlines due on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. This is where my high conscientiousness really needs to kick in. I can\u2019t afford to miss any more classes, and I need to dedicate serious time to catching up on the material I missed.\n\nMy goals for next week are clear:\n1.  **Prioritize academics:** Attend *all* my classes. No excuses. I need to be in LSB, Cummings, and Silsby-Rocky.\n2.  **Tackle deadlines head-on:** Create a detailed study plan for all those assignments due early next week. Sudikoff Hall will probably be seeing a lot more of me.\n3.  **Maintain balance:** While academics are the priority, I still want to keep up with my boathouse commitments and maybe even find a little time for something creative. It\u2019s important for my overall well-being.\n4.  **Boost knowledge:** Actively engage with the course material to bring that knowledge score up.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a challenging week, but I\u2019m ready to put in the work.

Looking back, it's pretty clear I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes, which is definitely something I need to address. My class experience summary says \"no class experience recorded,\" and that's spot on. I missed ENGS 069, ENGS 022, and ANTH 012 every single day they met. It wasn't intentional neglect, more like I got really absorbed in other things.\n\nA huge chunk of my time, especially early in the week, seemed to be spent around the Boathouse. I'm not sure what exactly I was doing there for so many hours, but it felt like a good place to just... be. Maybe I was just unwinding, or thinking, or perhaps it was a quiet spot to try and focus, even if it wasn't always productive. It's a peaceful place, and sometimes I just need that space.\n\nThen there's the Hopkins Center. I spent a lot of time there, especially Thursday, Friday, and Monday evenings. That's where a lot of my energy went. Being involved in the performing arts is incredibly fulfilling, and those hours just fly by. It's a creative outlet that I really value, and it definitely boosts my spirits. It's a place where I feel a strong sense of purpose and connection.\n\nThe flip side of that, of course, is the academic catch-up. With all the time I spent elsewhere, I ended up pulling some late nights in Sudikoff Hall, especially heading into Sunday and Tuesday. It was a bit of a scramble, trying to get things done. I know I was there late on Sunday and then again Tuesday night, practically until dawn on Wednesday. It's that classic university student grind, I guess. My conscientiousness kicks in hard when deadlines loom, and boy, do they loom! I've got a bunch due Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so that explains the late-night push.\n\nMy overall status feels pretty balanced, which is interesting given how much I deviated from my class schedule. My sleep and stamina are surprisingly high, which is great \u2013 I'm not feeling burnt out physically. Happiness and social levels are right in the middle, which feels accurate. I'm not ecstatic, but I'm not down either. The performing arts involvement definitely helps with the social aspect, even if it's not broad social interaction, it's deep and meaningful.\n\nThe biggest challenge this week was definitely balancing my commitments. I love being involved in the arts, and the boathouse offers a different kind of escape, but it clearly came at the expense of my classes. It's a tough trade-off, and I know I can't keep missing lectures, especially with so many assignments piling up. My knowledge level is still pretty good, but I can feel it slipping if I don't engage with the course material more directly.\n\nFor next week, my main goal is to get back on track with my academics. I need to prioritize attending all my classes \u2013 ENGS 069, ENGS 022, and ANTH 012. I'll make sure I'm at lsb, cummings, and silsby-rocky when I'm supposed to be. I also need to get a head start on those upcoming assignments so I'm not pulling all-nighters right before they're due.

My conscientiousness is definitely kicking in, telling me I need to get my act together.\n\nDespite missing classes, I wasn't just sitting around. I spent a good chunk of time at the Admissions Office, which I really enjoy. It's rewarding to help out there, and I had a couple of \"activity\" spikes there on Friday and Tuesday evenings. It\u2019s a nice way to feel connected to the university in a different capacity, and I think it taps into my more agreeable side, being helpful and all.\n\nThe Hopkins Center for the Arts was another big draw this week. I was there multiple evenings, and it was great to immerse myself in something creative. There was definitely an \"activity\" happening on Friday and Monday evenings, which was a fantastic way to unwind and engage with the arts. My openness really appreciates those experiences, and it\u2019s a good outlet for my extraverted energy too.\n\nI also found myself spending a lot of late-night hours at Sudikoff Hall, the CS building. I had a couple of \"activity\" sessions there, one super late on Thursday and another late Tuesday night. I think this is where my \"knowledge: 55\" comes in \u2013 there's a particular area I'm trying to wrap my head around, and it's been a real challenge. It's frustrating, but I'm determined to push through it. It\u2019s probably why my general knowledge feels high (85), but this specific area is a struggle.\n\nAnd then there's the Boathouse Road. I spent an unusual amount of time in that general area, especially over the weekend and early mornings.

I think I got a bit swept up in the flow of things, enjoying the social and extracurricular side of campus a little too much.\n\nThe biggest challenge for next week is going to be getting back on track academically. I've got a whole pile of deadlines looming \u2013 multiple things due Monday, then Tuesday, and Wednesday. The sheer number is a bit daunting, and I know I'll need to put in some serious work to catch up on what I missed in class *and* get those assignments done. My conscientiousness is kicking in now, telling me it's time to buckle down.\n\nSo, my goals for the upcoming week are crystal clear:\n1.  **Prioritize academics:** I need to make sure I'm attending all my classes and actively engaging with the material.\n2.  **Catch up:** Review everything I missed this week. I'll probably reach out to some classmates for notes and clarification.\n3.  **Tackle deadlines:** Break down those assignments and start chipping away at them immediately. I want to submit quality work, not just rush through.\n4.  **Maintain balance:** While academics are the priority, I also want to keep that high level of well-being. I'll make sure to still get enough sleep and find time for social connections, even if it's just quick breaks.\n\nI'm feeling optimistic. I know I can get back on track and manage everything. It's just a matter of shifting gears and applying that focus where it needs to be.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina**: 95 because the student explicitly states, \"My energy levels are through the roof.\"\n- **Knowledge**: 15 because the student admits, \"I completely missed all my scheduled classes this week\" and notes, \"My knowledge score is definitely reflecting that.\"\n- **Stress**: 70 because they describe the situation as \"a bit of a wake-up call\" and mention \"a whole pile of deadlines looming\" which they find \"a bit daunting,\" indicating significant pressure.\n- **Happy**: 85 because despite academic setbacks, the student starts by saying, \"I'm feeling pretty fantastic right now,\" had a \"really positive week,\" and ends by \"feeling optimistic\" about getting back on track.\n- **Sleep**: 98 because the student reports, \"I've been sleeping like a log,\" indicating excellent sleep quality and quantity.\n- **Social**: 95 because the student states, \"my social battery is completely charged,\" \"feeling super connected,\" and enjoyed \"the social and extracurricular side of campus a little too much.\""}

My stats say I'm doing great \u2013 happy, well-rested, social, plenty of stamina. And honestly, I do feel pretty good. But looking back, it was definitely a week of contrasts, especially when it comes to academics.\n\nI spent an awful lot of time at the Boathouse. It's become this strange sort of home base for me, a place where I can just... be. Sometimes I try to get work done there, but a lot of the time, it feels like I'm just existing. It's peaceful, but maybe a little *too* peaceful, if that makes sense. I noticed I was there for most of the week, just kind of chilling.\n\nThe biggest thing that hit me reflecting on it is that I didn't make it to any of my classes. Not ENGS 069, not ENGS 022, and not ANTH 012. It's not like I planned to skip them, but somehow the days just slipped away. One minute it's morning, and the next, I'm realizing I missed another lecture. My knowledge stat definitely reflects that; I don't feel like I absorbed much new information this week at all. That's a bit concerning, especially with how much I usually enjoy learning and diving into new topics.\n\nInstead, I found myself drawn to the Hopkins Center for the Arts quite a bit. There was just so much going on there, and I really enjoyed soaking in the creative energy. It's a different kind of learning, I guess, but it definitely took up a chunk of my time and focus. I also managed to connect with friends, which always boosts my social battery. It's good to know I'm keeping up with those connections.\n\nBut now, looking at the upcoming deadlines, a bit of that high happiness is starting to get tempered with a healthy dose of reality. There are so many assignments due on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It's a bit of a mountain to climb, especially since I haven't been keeping up with the material. My conscientiousness is definitely kicking in now, telling me I need to get serious.\n\nSo, for next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize Class Attendance:** No more accidental skips. I need to be in those lectures, absorbing the material. I'll set extra alarms and make a point of leaving the Boathouse well in advance.\n2.  **Tackle Deadlines Head-On:** I need to break down those assignments and start chipping away at them immediately. No more procrastinating. I'll probably spend less time at the Boathouse and more time in a library or a study space where I can really focus.\n3.  **Re-engage with Course Material:** Even if I can't catch up on everything from this past week, I need to at least get a handle on what's coming up and what's expected. My knowledge needs a serious boost.\n\nIt was a week where I felt good and explored some interests, but I definitely let my academic responsibilities slide. Time to balance that out and get back on track. I know I can do it.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina:** 95 - The student explicitly states, \"My stats say I'm doing great \u2013 ... plenty of stamina.

My stats are surprisingly high \u2013 happy, well-rested, social, and full of stamina. It\u2019s a testament to how much I\u2019m enjoying the things I\u2019m pouring my energy into, even if it means some other areas are\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say they need a bit more attention.\n\nA huge chunk of my week, as usual, was spent down at the Boathouse. Those early morning sessions are brutal, but there\u2019s something incredibly grounding about being out on the water as the sun comes up. And the evening practices, too \u2013 it\u2019s a full commitment, but the team dynamic and the physical challenge are so rewarding. I also spent a lot of time at the Hop this week. There were a few intense rehearsal blocks, and it\u2019s just such a vibrant place to be. I love being immersed in the creative energy there, whether it\u2019s a late-night practice or just soaking in a performance. It really feeds my soul and keeps my social battery charged.\n\nNow, for the elephant in the room: classes. Looking back, I realize I didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. That's definitely not ideal, and it's something I need to address head-on. My conscientiousness is kicking in, and I feel a real pang of guilt about missing ENGS 069, ENGS 022, and ANTH 012. I know the material is building up, and with so many deadlines looming \u2013 a bunch for Monday, then Tuesday and Wednesday \u2013 I can't afford to fall behind. I was in Sudikoff quite a bit late at night, trying to get ahead on some of the CS work, which I guess is a good sign that I'm aware of the academic pressure. But that doesn't excuse missing lectures.\n\nIt\u2019s a tricky balance, trying to excel in my extracurriculars while keeping up with a demanding academic load. I thrive on being busy and engaged, and I genuinely love what I do outside of classes. But I also know that my primary purpose here is to learn and get my degree. My knowledge stat is decent, but I know it could be better if I were consistently in class.\n\nMy goal for next week is clear: I need to get back into a consistent class attendance routine. I'm going to review all the missed lecture notes and readings for ENGS 069, ENGS 022, and ANTH 012 over the weekend. I'll also prioritize tackling those upcoming deadlines, especially the ones for Monday. I need to be more strategic about my time management, perhaps scheduling dedicated study blocks that are non-negotiable, even with Boathouse and Hop commitments. I want to maintain this high level of happiness and energy, but I also need to ensure it's sustainable and doesn't come at the expense of my academic responsibilities.

My energy levels are high, I'm sleeping well, and my social battery is definitely charged. It's great to feel so connected and supported by the people around me.\n\nAcademically, it's a bit of a mixed bag, which is something I really need to dig into. The system might say 'no class experience recorded this week,' and while that's technically true for attendance in the traditional sense, it's not for lack of trying to keep up. I spent a significant chunk of Wednesday at the Boathouse, which was intense but incredibly rewarding. It meant missing my ENGS 022, ENGS 069, and ANTH 012 lectures, which is definitely not ideal for my conscientiousness. I was up super early at Sudikoff trying to get ahead on some problem sets before heading out, knowing I'd be out of pocket for the day. It's a tough balance, and while I feel my general knowledge base is solid\u2014that 80% feels right for my overall understanding\u2014I can definitely feel a dip in specific areas. Especially in one of the ENGS courses, I feel like I'm only at 35% right now, and that's a red flag I absolutely need to address.\n\nBeyond the Boathouse, campus life felt vibrant. Even though the sensing data for Wednesday only shows me at Sudikoff and the Boathouse, I've been making sure to connect with friends and keep that social energy flowing. It's so important to have those connections, and I really value the people around me.\n\nThe biggest challenge looming is definitely the sheer number of deadlines. I've got three due Monday, three more on Tuesday, and then another four by Wednesday. That's a lot to juggle, especially with the ground I need to make up from missing classes. It's a bit daunting, but I'm trying to break it down into manageable chunks.\n\nMy main goal for next week is to get back on track with my classes. I need to review the material I missed, especially for that ENGS course where I'm feeling behind. I'll be reaching out to TAs or classmates to catch up on notes and concepts. And then, it's all about tackling those deadlines strategically. I'll map out my time, prioritize, and make sure I'm not just rushing through things.
