Definitely not what I expected, and honestly, I'm feeling a bit all over the place about it.\n\nThe biggest thing, and I know this is going to sound bad, is that I didn't make it to any of my classes. Not a single one. ECON, COSC 050, COSC 065 \u2013 all missed. I saw the summary said \"no class experience,\" and yeah, that's painfully accurate. It wasn't intentional, not really. It's just\u2026 I found this pottery studio, Davidson Pottery Studio, and it just completely absorbed me. I spent so much time there, especially Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday mornings. It's a bit of a drive, being in Vermont and all, but once I'm there, I just lose track of time. There's something so incredibly freeing about working with clay, shaping something with your hands. It\u2019s a completely different kind of challenge than what I get in my classes, and I just got really, really into it. I guess my openness really kicked in there, because I just dove headfirst into this new thing.\n\nBut then, the guilt started to creep in. Especially with all those deadlines looming. I mean, there are so many due Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Just looking at that list makes my stomach clench a little. My conscientiousness is screaming at me for letting things slide. I know I *should* have been in Kemeny and LSB, learning what I needed to for these assignments. Now I'm going to have to play catch-up, and that's a pretty stressful thought.\n\nMy sleep has been good, which is a relief, and my stamina feels fine, but my schedule has been a bit chaotic. I was up late a few times, like Sunday night at Fairchild and then again early Tuesday morning at the Boathouse. It feels like I'm just bouncing around, trying to fit everything in, but not really succeeding at anything. I did manage to get to the gym on Monday night, which was good for blowing off some steam, and I was around Sudikoff a bit, but not for anything productive, it seems.\n\nSocially, I feel pretty average. I haven't really connected with people much this week, probably because I was off-campus so much. It's a weird feeling, being so engrossed in something new but also feeling a bit isolated from the usual campus rhythm.\n\nThe main challenge, obviously, is the academic fallout from missing all my classes. I'm worried about falling behind, especially with COSC. And the sheer number of deadlines is intimidating. My neuroticism is definitely flaring up, making me second-guess everything and worry about how I'm going to manage.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Get back to class.** No matter what, I need to be in Kemeny and LSB for ECON, COSC 050, and COSC 065. I need to prioritize my studies.\n2.  **Tackle those deadlines head-on.** I need to figure out what I missed and start chipping away at those assignments immediately. No more procrastinating.\n3.  **Find a balance with pottery.** I love it, I really do, but it can't come at the expense of my degree. Maybe I can schedule specific, limited times for it, or find a studio closer to campus if that's an option. I need to be more disciplined with my time.\n4.  **Manage my anxiety.** This feeling of being overwhelmed isn't helping. I need to break down tasks into smaller steps and just focus on one thing at a time to avoid getting paralyzed by the sheer volume of work.\n\nThis week was a wake-up call. I need to be more responsible, even when I find something new and exciting.

I know I have classes \u2013 ECON 036, COSC 050, COSC 065 \u2013 but looking back, I didn't make it to any of them. Not a single one. It\u2019s weird, because I *want* to be on top of things, I really do. My brain feels like it\u2019s capable of understanding the material, but actually getting myself to Kemeny or LSB at 8:45 AM or 10:00 AM just didn't happen. It\u2019s like there\u2019s this invisible wall. The system even says \"No class experience recorded this week,\" which just hits different. It\u2019s true, I guess. I wasn't *there*.\n\nInstead, I found myself in some really odd places at even odder hours. I spent so much time at that Davidson Pottery Studio in Vermont. I mean, it\u2019s a cool place, and I love the idea of just getting lost in something creative, but it\u2019s not exactly on campus, and I was there for hours, sometimes in the middle of the night, sometimes during the day when I should have been in class. A lot of that time was just\u2026 \"No Activity.\" Just being there, I guess. It\u2019s a bit of an escape, I suppose, but it\u2019s clearly not helping with the academic side of things.\n\nMy sleep schedule is a mess, even though I feel like I'm getting enough hours in. I was up at Fairchild Physical Sciences Center until 3 AM some nights, then back there at 1 AM, or at the Hopkins Center. Sometimes I was actually doing something, sometimes just\u2026 existing. Then I\u2019d be at the pottery studio for half the day, missing everything. It\u2019s a cycle that\u2019s making me feel pretty low, honestly. My happiness score feels like it\u2019s taken a hit, and I can definitely feel the stress building up. All these deadlines popping up \u2013 Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday \u2013 it\u2019s a lot, and I haven\u2019t even started on some of them because I\u2019ve been so off-kilter.\n\nSocially, I feel a bit disconnected. I was at Zahm Courtyard early in the week, and the Boathouse a few times, but it wasn't really *social* social. More just being in places. I guess I haven't really put myself out there much this week, which is a shame because I usually enjoy connecting with people.\n\nI know I\u2019m capable, and I want to do well. My knowledge feels high, but it\u2019s not translating into actual work or attendance. It\u2019s frustrating. This week felt like I was just drifting, pulled by whatever impulse came next, rather than sticking to a plan.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to get back on track. My main goal is simple: **attend every single class.** No more excuses. I need to be present, physically and mentally. Second, I need to **tackle these deadlines head-on**. I\u2019ll make a list, break them down, and actually start working on them during daylight hours. And finally, I need to **re-evaluate my time at the pottery studio**. It\u2019s a great outlet, but it can\u2019t be at the expense of my studies. Maybe I can set specific, limited times for it, or find a creative outlet closer to campus.

What\u2019s sleep?\n\nThe biggest thing, and it\u2019s hard to even write it down, is that I didn't make it to a single one of my classes this week. Not Econ, not COSC 050, not COSC 065. It\u2019s a mess. I know I should have been there, especially with how much material we\u2019re covering. But I just kept finding myself drawn to the pottery studio. It\u2019s like a different world there, a place where I can just lose myself in the clay and the process. The hours just melt away, and before I know it, it\u2019s the middle of the night or the next morning. I guess that explains why I was there so much, even at weird hours like 4 AM on Friday or all day Saturday and Sunday. It\u2019s a passion, and it feels so good to create, but it\u2019s clearly eating into everything else.\n\nMy sleep schedule is completely shot because of it. I was up at Fairchild late into the night, then sometimes at the Boathouse, then back to the pottery studio at dawn. It\u2019s no wonder my stamina is so low. I\u2019m constantly tired, and that just makes it harder to focus or even care about anything else. I did manage to get some work done at the library on Friday, and I\u2019ve been trying to keep up with the material on my own, which I guess is why my knowledge levels are still pretty high. But it\u2019s not the same as being in class, engaging with the professors and my peers.\n\nSpeaking of peers, my social life this week was practically non-existent. I barely saw anyone outside of fleeting moments. I popped into the dining hall once, and was at my dorm, but mostly I was either at the pottery studio, Fairchild, or the Boathouse, often alone. I know I need to connect with people more, but when I\u2019m this tired and stressed, it\u2019s hard to even think about it.\n\nAnd the deadlines\u2026 oh god, the deadlines. They\u2019re just looming over me, a constant reminder of everything I\u2019m falling behind on. There are so many due this Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It\u2019s making me incredibly anxious, and I feel this knot in my stomach just thinking about how much I have to catch up on. It\u2019s a lot of pressure, and I\u2019m feeling the weight of it.\n\nFor next week, I absolutely *have* to get back on track. My main goal is to actually attend all my classes. No excuses. I need to figure out a way to manage my time better, especially with the pottery. Maybe I can set specific, limited hours for it, or only go on weekends, so it doesn't completely derail my academic responsibilities. I also desperately need to prioritize sleep. I can\u2019t keep burning the candle at both ends like this; it\u2019s clearly impacting my mood and my ability to function. I need to tackle those upcoming assignments head-on and try to get ahead, or at least caught up, so I don't feel this crushing anxiety anymore.

Every time ECON 036, COSC 050, or COSC 065 was supposed to be happening, I found myself completely absorbed at the Davidson Pottery Studio.

It's exhausting, and it's clearly not sustainable. I can feel the pressure building, especially with all these deadlines popping up \u2013 a bunch due Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It's a lot to juggle when you're already behind.\n\nOn the flip side, my social battery is definitely full.

It feels like a blur, honestly. On one hand, I'm feeling pretty good, like my social life is really thriving, which is awesome. I've been out and about, catching up with people, and that always boosts my mood. My happiness level is definitely up there, which is great.\n\nBut then there's the other side of the coin. My sleep? Non-existent. Seriously, a 2 out of 10? That's rough. And my stamina is right there with it, barely clinging on at a 5. I know exactly why, too. I spent so many late nights in Fairchild and Sudikoff this week. It felt like I was practically living there, especially Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, just grinding away. I was there until 3, 4, even 5 AM some nights, just trying to get through everything. And then again on Monday and Tuesday nights. It's a cycle, I know.\n\nThe weird thing is, even though I was pulling those crazy hours, I didn't actually make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. Not a single one. I saw the schedule for ECON, COSC 050, COSC 065, but I just couldn't drag myself there. It's a bit of a worry, because I know I'm missing out on the lectures and discussions. Still, I feel like I'm keeping up with the material, at least knowledge-wise, from all the self-study. It's just not the ideal way to do it.\n\nI did manage to get out to the Boathouse a few times, which was nice, and ran some errands at the Post Office. There were also a couple of late-night excursions off campus, which were probably more social than anything else. That's probably where the high social score comes from. It's a balancing act, and right now, the scales are definitely tipped towards social and late-night work, and away from sleep and actual class attendance.\n\nLooking at the upcoming deadlines is a bit daunting. So many due on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. That's probably why I've been pushing so hard. It feels like there's always something looming.\n\nMy biggest challenge right now is definitely this sleep deprivation and the resulting lack of stamina. It's not sustainable, and I can feel it wearing me down, even if I'm generally happy. I also need to figure out how to actually *attend* my classes. I'm learning the material, but being there in person makes a difference.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize sleep:** I need to get more than a couple of hours a night. I'm going to try to set a hard stop time for studying, even if it means not finishing everything perfectly.\n2.  **Boost stamina:** With more sleep, hopefully, my energy levels will naturally improve. Maybe even try to squeeze in some actual exercise that isn't just walking between buildings.\n3.  **Attend classes:** This is non-negotiable. I need to be in those lectures. I'll try to shift my study schedule earlier in the day so I'm not so exhausted by morning.\n4.  **Manage deadlines proactively:** Instead of cramming last minute, I need to break down the work for those upcoming deadlines into smaller, more manageable chunks throughout the week.\n\nIt's a lot, but I'm determined to get back on track. I know I can do it, I just need to find a better rhythm.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n-   **Stamina:** The student explicitly states, \"my stamina is right there with it, barely clinging on at a 5.\" This is further supported by their inability to \"drag myself there\" to classes and feeling \"worn down\" by sleep deprivation.\n-   **Knowledge:** Despite missing all scheduled classes, the student states, \"I feel like I'm keeping up with the material, at least knowledge-wise, from all the self-study.\" They acknowledge it's \"not the ideal way,\" but imply they are still learning effectively.\n-   **Stress:** The student mentions \"Looking at the upcoming deadlines is a bit daunting\" and that \"It feels like there's always something looming,\" indicating significant pressure and worry.

I feel like I'm running on fumes, my stamina is practically non-existent, and sleep? What's sleep? But weirdly, despite all that, I'm still feeling pretty good, especially socially. My social battery is definitely topped up, which is a huge plus.\n\nClasses... yeah, that's where things got a bit messy. I know the system says \"no class experience recorded,\" and that's pretty accurate. I ended up spending a ridiculous amount of time at the Davidson Pottery Studio this week. It's just... it's become such an intense passion. I get so lost in it, the clay, the wheel, the whole process. It's incredibly creatively fulfilling, and honestly, it feels like a real escape from everything else. I know it's off-campus, and it's a private business, but it's where I felt drawn to be. It's like I discover something new about myself every time I'm there.\n\nThe downside, of course, is that it completely threw off my class schedule. I missed pretty much everything. Then I'd be scrambling late at night, pulling all-nighters in Sudikoff or Fairchild, trying to catch up on COSC and ECON material. It's a constant cycle of feeling behind, then cramming, then feeling exhausted. My brain feels like it's buzzing with all the information, which is good for my knowledge levels, but my body is definitely protesting. The sheer number of deadlines looming over me doesn't help either \u2013 it's like a constant low hum of anxiety in the background.\n\nBut then I'd grab food at the Commons or hang out at the Boathouse, or even just wander around with friends, and suddenly, I'd feel a surge of happiness. It's like the social connections are what keep me afloat, even when everything else feels like it's spiraling. I even ended up at Hanover High School for some reason on Saturday night, which was... an experience. And that late-night trip to Jewel of India was definitely a highlight.\n\nThe challenge is clearly the balance. I'm so drawn to this new creative outlet, and my social life is thriving, but my academic structure is crumbling. I know I'm capable of understanding the material, but showing up to lectures is a basic requirement, and I just didn't manage it this week. It's frustrating because I *want* to be on top of things, but I also don't want to give up this new thing that brings me so much joy.\n\nSo, for next week, my goals are pretty clear, even if they feel daunting. First, I absolutely *have* to get to all my classes. No more pottery studio during lecture times. I need to be present and engaged. Second, I need to figure out a way to get more sleep. Two hours a night is just not sustainable, and I can feel it wearing me down, even if I'm trying to ignore it. Maybe I can schedule my pottery time more intentionally, perhaps in the evenings or on the weekend, so it doesn't clash with my academic responsibilities. It's about finding that sweet spot where I can pursue my passions without completely sacrificing my well-being and my grades. It's going to be tough, but I have to try.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina:** The student explicitly states, \"I feel like I'm running on fumes, my stamina is practically non-existent,\" and \"my body is definitely protesting,\" further noting that \"Two hours a night is just not sustainable, and I can feel it wearing me down.\" This indicates extremely low physical and mental energy.\n- **Knowledge:** Despite missing classes, the student mentions, \"My brain feels like it's buzzing with all the information, which is good for my knowledge levels,\" and \"I know I'm capable of understanding the material,\" indicating a strong grasp or active acquisition of academic content through cramming.\n- **Stress:** The student describes \"a constant low hum of anxiety in the background\" due to \"the sheer number of deadlines looming over me\" and feeling caught in \"a constant cycle of feeling behind, then cramming, then feeling exhausted,\" highlighting very high stress levels.\n- **Happy:** Despite academic struggles, the student reports \"still feeling pretty good,\" finding pottery \"incredibly creatively fulfilling\" and a source of \"so much joy.\" They also experience \"a surge of happiness\" from social interactions.\n- **Sleep:** The student dramatically asks, \"sleep?

It\u2019s a weird contradiction.\n\nAcademically, it was a bit of a mess. I know I had classes, especially on Thursday, but I just couldn't make it. I spent a huge chunk of Thursday at that pottery studio in Vermont, which was totally unexpected but also kind of amazing. I guess my high openness just kicked in and I needed to explore something completely different. It was a nice break from everything, a chance to just create and not think about problem sets or readings. But then the guilt started to creep in, especially knowing I missed ECON and COSC 065. My conscientiousness is screaming at me to get back on track.\n\nWednesday night was a blur. I was at Fairchild super late, trying to get some work done, and I think I pulled an all-nighter or something close to it. That probably explains why I was so utterly drained by Thursday morning. I ended up at Sudikoff later on Thursday, so I did manage to get *some* COSC-related stuff done, but it wasn't the focused class time I needed.\n\nThe biggest challenge right now is definitely sleep. How am I supposed to function on so little? And then there are all these deadlines looming. Seriously, so many things due Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday\u2026 it\u2019s overwhelming just looking at the list. My neuroticism is definitely flaring up when I think about how much I have to catch up on, especially with the classes I missed.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize sleep.** I *have* to get more rest. This isn't sustainable.\n2.  **Catch up on missed material.** I need to review what I missed in ECON and COSC 065, and make sure I understand it before the next lectures.\n3.  **Tackle those deadlines head-on.** I need to break them down and start chipping away at them, especially the ones due early in the week. No more last-minute scrambles if I can help it.\n4.  **Re-establish my routine.** I thrive on structure, and this week felt a bit too free-form. I need to get back into a consistent study schedule.\n\nI loved the social aspect of this week, and the pottery was a cool experience, but I need to find a better balance.

It feels like a blur, honestly. My brain is definitely running on fumes right now, which is probably why I'm even writing this.\n\nClasses this week were... a lot. Waking up for ECON 036 every morning at Kemeny is a commitment, especially when I feel like I barely closed my eyes. Professor [Professor's name, if I had one, but I don't, so I'll just say 'the prof'] is good, but sometimes it feels like my brain is trying to process the material through a thick fog. COSC 065 over at LSB was interesting, though. I really enjoy diving into the concepts there; it feels like my brain lights up, even when my body is screaming for a nap. And then COSC 050 in the afternoons, back at Kemeny \u2013 it's a good challenge, and I feel like I'm really grasping the core ideas, which is satisfying. I feel pretty confident about the material in all my classes, actually. It's just the *energy* to engage with it that's the problem.\n\nCampus life was pretty vibrant, as usual. I spent a lot of time just hanging out between classes, grabbing coffee, chatting with people. That's probably where a lot of my energy went, actually. I love being around my friends, and there was always something going on. Whether it was just a quick catch-up or a longer conversation, I felt really connected and happy. It's definitely a huge part of what makes me feel good here.\n\nHow did I feel? Honestly, a mix of really happy and utterly exhausted. My social battery is fully charged \u2013 I feel great about my connections and the fun I had. But my actual physical battery? Completely drained. I'm running on fumes, and it's starting to catch up with me. My stamina is practically non-existent. It's like my mind is buzzing with ideas and connections from classes and conversations, but my body just wants to collapse. There's also this low hum of anxiety about all the deadlines piling up. I know I'm capable, and I understand the material, but the sheer *volume* of things due next week is a bit overwhelming when I'm this tired.\n\nThe biggest challenge, hands down, was sleep. Or the lack thereof. I just haven't been getting enough, and it's impacting everything. It makes it harder to focus in class, harder to feel motivated to start assignments, and even harder to fully enjoy the social stuff because I'm constantly fighting off yawns. Balancing the desire to be social and engaged with the absolute necessity of rest has been a real struggle. It feels like I'm always choosing between one or the other, and this week, social won out, but at a cost.\n\nSo, for next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize sleep.** Seriously. I need to make a conscious effort to get to bed earlier, even if it means saying no to some late-night plans. My brain and body desperately need it.\n2.  **Get a head start on assignments.** With so many deadlines looming (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday \u2013 it's a lot!), I can't afford to procrastinate. I need to break them down and tackle them bit by bit, especially the COSC ones.\n3.  **Manage my time better.** I need to find a way to balance my social life with my academic responsibilities and, crucially, my rest. Maybe schedule specific blocks for studying and specific blocks for socializing, rather than just letting things happen organically.\n\nI'm still happy to be here, and I love what I'm learning and the people around me.
