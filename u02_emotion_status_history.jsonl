But then I look at my schedule and what I actually *did*, and there\u2019s this knot in my stomach.\n\nI didn't make it to any of my scheduled classes this week. Not COSC 077, not COSC 065. It\u2019s a pretty big deal, and honestly, it\u2019s been weighing on me. My brain just keeps replaying the fact that I missed them all. I know I should have been there, especially with all these deadlines piling up. It\u2019s like I have this internal alarm going off, telling me I\u2019m falling behind, and it\u2019s hard to ignore.\n\nInstead of lectures, I found myself bouncing around a lot. I spent a fair bit of time at the Boathouse \u2013 it\u2019s a good place to clear my head, or just zone out, I guess. I also ended up at the Admissions Office and McNutt Hall a couple of times. Nothing major, just some administrative stuff I needed to sort out, but it definitely ate into my time.\n\nI did manage to get some actual work done, though. I was in Sudikoff Hall, hitting the CS labs, and also spent some time in the Life Sciences Center. It wasn't during class, but I was trying to chip away at some of the assignments. There are so many due next week \u2013 like, a ridiculous number of them, especially on Monday and Tuesday. That's probably why I felt like I needed to be *doing* something productive, even if it meant skipping lectures. It\u2019s a trade-off, and I\u2019m not sure it was the right one. The thought of all those deadlines is just\u2026 a lot.\n\nI also made it to the Hopkins Center for the Arts a couple of times. It was nice to just step away from everything and experience something different, a bit of a mental break. It helps to reset, even if it's just for an hour or two.\n\nOverall, I'm feeling a bit of a mixed bag. I'm well-rested, which is a huge plus, but the anxiety about missing classes and the looming deadlines is definitely there. My knowledge feels stagnant, which is concerning. I know I need to be more disciplined.\n\nFor next week, my absolute top priority is getting back into the rhythm of attending all my classes. No excuses. I need to be in Steele for COSC 077 and LSB for COSC 065. I also need to create a super detailed plan for tackling these assignments. I can't afford to let them pile up any more. I'm going to try to dedicate specific blocks of time to each one, and maybe even find a study group to keep myself accountable. I need to get my knowledge levels up and reduce this underlying stress.

Or, well, mostly done. It feels like a blur, honestly.\n\nThis week was\u2026 a lot. The system says \"no class experience recorded,\" and yeah, that's pretty accurate. I somehow managed to miss *all* my scheduled classes this week \u2013 COSC 065 and COSC 077. Every single one. I don't even know how that happened. One minute it's 9 AM, and the next I'm realizing I've completely zoned out or gotten caught up in something else, and class is already over or I'm too late to even bother. It's not like I was out partying or anything, just\u2026 not where I was supposed to be. That feeling of missing something important, it just gnaws at me. My conscientiousness is screaming right now, telling me I've completely dropped the ball.\n\nDespite missing classes, I feel like I was constantly *doing* something, or at least trying to. I spent a lot of time in Sudikoff and Fairchild, especially late at night and early in the morning. Like, I was at Fairchild until 4 AM on Sunday night/Monday morning, and then back at the library on Monday evening. And Sudikoff on Saturday evening. It's all about trying to catch up, I guess. The deadlines are just piling up \u2013 so many due on Monday and Tuesday. It's a constant battle to stay on top of things, and honestly, the anxiety is pretty high right now. I know I have a good grasp of the material (my knowledge score is high, thankfully), but the sheer volume of work and the feeling of being behind is just overwhelming.\n\nSocially, it was a pretty quiet week. My social battery is definitely on low, or maybe just non-existent. I didn't really connect with anyone, just kind of kept to myself, trying to power through assignments.

Despite feeling so stressed and unhappy (my happiness is definitely in the gutter), I've actually been sleeping really well, and my stamina feels good. So, physically, I'm fine, which is a small mercy, I guess. It just makes the mental exhaustion and the constant worry about falling behind even more frustrating.\n\nMy biggest challenge this week was definitely getting to class and managing my time effectively. I need to figure out why I kept missing them. Was I too focused on other things? Was I just completely disoriented? Whatever it was, it can't happen again.\n\nFor next week, my goals are clear:\n1.  **Attend every single class.** No excuses. I need to be there, engaged, and not let myself get sidetracked.\n2.  **Tackle those deadlines head-on.** I've got a bunch coming up, and I need to break them down and get them done without pulling all-nighters every night.\n3.  **Re-evaluate my schedule.** Clearly, something isn't working. I need to be more intentional with my time, especially around class hours.\n4.  Maybe, just maybe, try to grab coffee with someone.

Seriously, a dozen things due in the next few days? It\u2019s a lot.\n\nThe biggest thing, and it\u2019s hard to even write this, is that I completely fell off the wagon with classes. COSC 077, COSC 065\u2026 I missed them all. Every single one. I know, I know, it\u2019s completely unlike me. My conscientiousness is usually through the roof, and I pride myself on being on top of things. But this week, it was like a mental block. I\u2019d wake up, tell myself I was going to go, and then just\u2026 couldn\u2019t. I spent so much time just holed up at the Boathouse, doing nothing, or at least nothing productive for class. It\u2019s frustrating because I *know* I need to be there, and the knowledge scores show I understand the material, but the actual act of getting myself to class felt impossible.\n\nInstead of class, I tried to make up for it by hitting the library on Friday afternoon. And I did spend a good chunk of time in Sudikoff on Wednesday and Sunday evenings, trying to get a head start on some of the assignments. I know there's a lot of work to do, and I can't afford to fall behind. It's just the *showing up* part that's been the struggle.\n\nMy social life is practically non-existent, which isn't helping. I barely saw anyone this week, and my social score is proof of that. I guess that's why I'm spending so much time at the Boathouse \u2013 it's my safe space, but it's also isolating.\n\nThere were a couple of odd moments too. I found myself at the Admissions Office on Thursday afternoon, and then again, super late, early Wednesday morning. I don't even know why I went back at 1 AM. It just felt like\u2026 something I needed to do, or maybe a place I felt drawn to when I was feeling overwhelmed. It\u2019s probably just adding to my stress, honestly.

Just needed to get away from campus for a bit, clear my head.\n\nDespite the low happiness and social scores, I've been getting a decent amount of sleep, and my stamina feels okay. It's like my body is fine, but my mind is just\u2026 not. The high neuroticism is definitely kicking in, making me overthink everything and just feel generally anxious about, well, everything.\n\nLooking ahead to next week, my absolute top priority has to be getting back into a routine and actually attending my classes. I need to break this cycle of avoidance. I also need to tackle these deadlines head-on. There are so many of them, and I can't let them overwhelm me. Maybe I need to try and connect with someone, even just for a quick chat, to break out of this isolation.

My brain is buzzing with all the COSC stuff, and my body just feels\u2026 tired. Even though the system says my sleep is good, I'm running on fumes, and my stamina is definitely feeling it.\n\nAcademically, it was a pretty intense week. I spent a huge chunk of my time in Sudikoff and Steele, especially Thursday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings. It felt like I was practically living in the CS buildings, just grinding through assignments. There are so many deadlines piling up \u2013 a bunch due Monday, Tuesday, and then another one on Wednesday. It's a constant source of low-level anxiety, always feeling like I'm just barely keeping my head above water. My knowledge score is high, which is a relief, but I'm not sure how sustainable this pace is.\n\nSpeaking of academics, I noticed the system didn't record me in any classes this week, and that's a bit frustrating. I *know* I have COSC 077 and COSC 065 scheduled, but between the sheer volume of assignments and my commitments at the Boathouse, it felt impossible to be everywhere. The Boathouse activities are a huge part of my week \u2013 those early mornings, late nights, even that midnight session on Sunday and the 2 AM one on Tuesday. It's a massive time commitment, and while I'm dedicated to it, it definitely takes a toll. It's probably why my stamina is so low, and why I'm feeling so drained.\n\nOutside of the academic grind and the Boathouse, there wasn't much else. I hit the gym a couple of times, which was good for a quick physical release, but didn't really boost my overall energy. I also spent some time at the Admissions Office on Friday and Monday, which is a regular thing for me. It's a different kind of work, which can be a nice change of pace. I even managed to squeeze in a quick visit to the Hood Museum on Monday \u2013 a rare moment of just\u2026 existing, without a task. And I did make it to the dining hall on Friday, so at least I'm remembering to eat.\n\nEmotionally, I'm feeling pretty stretched. My happiness is low, and my social life is practically non-existent. It's hard to connect with people when you're either buried in code or out on the water at odd hours. The constant pressure of deadlines and the feeling of being pulled in multiple directions definitely feeds into my neuroticism. I'm constantly worrying about whether I'm doing enough, if I'm missing something, or if I'm falling behind. It's a cycle that's hard to break.\n\nFor next week, I really need to try and get a better handle on things. My top priority is to actually attend my scheduled classes. I know the lectures are important, and I can't keep relying solely on self-study, even if it's worked so far. I also need to be more proactive with my assignments, maybe start them earlier in the week to avoid that last-minute scramble. And, if I can find even a small window, I want to try and make some time for actual social interaction. My social battery is completely dead, and I know it's not healthy to be this isolated.

I don't know what it is, but sometimes I just end up there, just\u2026 being. It's quiet, and I guess it's a place where I don't feel the pressure of everything else. Even had a couple of really early mornings there, which is weird, but it just felt like the only place to be. It's probably not the most productive use of time, but it's where I drift when I feel overwhelmed.\n\nSocially, it was pretty quiet. My social battery is definitely low. The only real break I got was heading out to the Two Rivers Conservation Area on Saturday evening. It was nice to get off campus for a bit, just to clear my head.

And I need to find a healthier way to decompress than just zoning out at the Boathouse. Maybe a walk, or actually reaching out to someone, even if my social energy is low.

That's a huge problem, and it's weighing on me. I pride myself on being on top of things, and this just feels like a massive failure. I was supposed to be in Steele and LSB, but I just wasn't there. I know I need to get a handle on that. It's not like I was just lounging around, though.\n\nA lot of my time, especially late at night and early in the morning, was spent at the Boathouse. It's a huge commitment, and it just eats up so much time and energy. I was there at 2 AM on Thursday, 2 AM and 3 AM on Saturday, 2 AM on Sunday, 3 AM on Monday, and 2 AM on Tuesday. It's intense, and I think that's a big part of why my sleep and stamina are so low. It's a passion, but it's definitely taking its toll.\n\nBeyond the Boathouse, I was in Sudikoff Hall a few times \u2013 Wednesday and Thursday evenings, and Monday afternoon. So, even though I missed lectures, I was still trying to keep up with my CS work, which I guess explains why my knowledge scores are still pretty high. It's just a lot of self-teaching and trying to catch up on my own. I also popped into the Admissions Office on Friday, which was a bit random, and spent some time in Fairchild and Vail, which are more academic buildings. There was even that super early morning visit to a private residence on Sunday, which was... interesting. And the Visual Arts Center late Friday night. My activities are all over the place, which is probably a sign of how scattered I feel.\n\nThe biggest challenge right now is definitely the sheer volume of deadlines. I've got so many things due Monday and Tuesday, and then another one on Wednesday. It feels like a constant uphill battle, and missing classes just adds to the pressure. I'm worried about falling behind, even though I'm trying to compensate by working in Sudikoff. My social life is practically non-existent, which isn't ideal, but honestly, I don't even have the energy for it right now.\n\nFor next week, my absolute top priority has to be class attendance. I *need* to be in Steele and LSB for COSC 077 and COSC 065. I also need to figure out a better balance with the Boathouse. I can't keep sacrificing sleep and my academic responsibilities for it, even if it's something I care about. I need to get ahead of these deadlines, not just react to them. And maybe, just maybe, I can carve out an hour or two to just *relax* or connect with someone, because this level of stress isn't sustainable. I just need to push through this, but I really hope I can find a way to manage everything better.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\nReasoning:\n- **Stamina:** The student explicitly states, \"I'm just so incredibly tired, and it feels like I'm constantly running on fumes. My stamina is shot.\" They also mention the Boathouse commitment \"eats up so much time and energy\" and that their \"stamina are so low,\" indicating extreme exhaustion and very low energy levels.\n- **Knowledge:** Despite missing classes, the student notes, \"I was still trying to keep up with my CS work, which I guess explains why my knowledge scores are still pretty high. It's just a lot of self-teaching and trying to catch up on my own.\" This suggests they are actively working to maintain their understanding, even if it's not through traditional attendance.\n- **Stress:** The student expresses significant stress due to \"missing all my COSC 077 and COSC 065 classes,\" feeling it's \"a massive failure.\" The \"sheer volume of deadlines\" is highlighted as \"the biggest challenge,\" creating \"a constant uphill battle\" and adding \"pressure.\" They explicitly state, \"this level of stress isn't sustainable.\"\n- **Happy:** The student directly states, \"My happy levels are definitely in the gutter,\" indicating a very low emotional state.\n- **Sleep:** The student rhetorically asks, \"sleep? What's sleep?\" and details late-night activities at the Boathouse (\"2 AM on Thursday, 2 AM and 3 AM on Saturday, 2 AM on Sunday, 3 AM on Monday, and 2 AM on Tuesday\"), explicitly linking these to why their \"sleep and stamina are so low.\"\n- **Social:** The student clearly states, \"My social life is practically non-existent,\" and adds that they \"don't even have the energy for it right now,\" indicating a complete lack of social engagement."}

It\u2019s a strange mix of feeling incredibly productive in some areas, but also a nagging sense of falling behind in others. My internal clock is definitely off-kilter, with all the early mornings and late nights.\n\nLooking at my class schedule, it\u2019s pretty clear I didn't make it to any of my COSC lectures this week. That's a tough pill to swallow, especially with how much I value keeping up. I know COSC 077 and 065 are important, and missing them just piles on the anxiety. It\u2019s not like I was just lounging around, though. Most of those times, I was down at the boathouse. It feels like a second home, and the commitment there is just\u2026 intense. We had so many sessions, sometimes starting before dawn, and then again in the afternoon. It\u2019s exhilarating, but it completely clashes with my class times.\n\nI did try to make up for it by spending time in Sudikoff and the library. I was in Sudikoff on Sunday night and again on Tuesday, and the library on Monday. I'm trying to piece together what I missed in lectures by going through the readings and problem sets. It's just not the same as being there, though, and I can feel the knowledge gap widening, which is really stressing me out. My knowledge stats might be high, but I know there are specific things from those lectures I'm missing.\n\nThe constant back-and-forth between the boathouse, academic buildings, and my dorm has been exhausting. My sleep schedule is all over the place \u2013 I was up at the boathouse at 4 AM on Friday, and again on Saturday and Sunday. Then I was at the Admissions Office at midnight on Sunday, and back at the boathouse at 2 AM and 4 AM. It\u2019s a lot. Even if I feel okay right now, I know this isn't sustainable long-term. The sheer number of upcoming deadlines, especially for Monday and Tuesday, is just looming over me. It feels like a mountain of work, and I'm already starting from a deficit.\n\nMy biggest challenge this week was definitely the time conflict between my boathouse commitments and my classes. It\u2019s a passion, but it\u2019s clearly impacting my academics, and that makes me incredibly nervous. I pride myself on being conscientious, and this feels like a failure.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize catching up on COSC 077 and 065.** I need to review all the material I missed and make sure I understand it before the next lectures. Maybe I can find a study group or talk to a TA.\n2.  **Strategize for the upcoming deadlines.** There are so many! I need to break them down and allocate specific time slots for each, especially since I'll be playing catch-up.\n3.  **Re-evaluate my schedule.** I need to figure out a way to balance the boathouse with my classes, or at least minimize the impact. Maybe I can shift some of my boathouse time, or find alternative ways to get the lecture content. This erratic sleep pattern isn't helping my focus either. I need to try and get more consistent rest.\n\nIt's going to be a tough week, but I'm determined to get back on track.

It feels like a blur, honestly. My sleep is definitely taking a hit \u2013 only a 3, which isn't great, but somehow I'm still feeling pretty happy, an 8, which is a bit of a surprise. Maybe it's the satisfaction of getting things done, even if it means sacrificing some Zs.\n\nThe big thing this week is that I barely made it to any of my scheduled classes. I saw the summary said \"No class experience recorded,\" and yeah, that tracks. COSC 077 and COSC 065, I missed pretty much all the lectures. I know, I know, it sounds bad, especially with how much I usually stress about attendance. My conscientiousness is screaming at me about it. But honestly, I felt like I was getting more done by focusing on the project work and diving deep into the material on my own. I spent so much time in Sudikoff and Fairchild, just grinding through problems and reading. My knowledge is at a 98, so I feel like I'm keeping up, even if it's not in the traditional way. It's a weird balance, this feeling of being on top of the content but also knowing I'm not showing up where I'm supposed to be. That neurotic side of me definitely feels a pang of guilt every time I think about it.\n\nThe Boathouse became my second home this week, especially during what should have been class times. I'm not sure what it is about that place, but it's where I ended up a lot, even late at night or super early in the morning. Sometimes it felt like a good escape, a place to clear my head, or maybe just a different environment to try and focus. I had a few \"Activity: Yes\" moments there, which probably means I was just trying to get some fresh air or think through a problem away from a screen.\n\nI did manage to get out a bit. Popped into the Admissions Office on Wednesday, and the Guarini Institute on Monday \u2013 not sure if those were social or just quick errands, but it was a change of scenery. My social score is a 5, which feels about right. I'm not going out of my way to be super social, but I'm not completely isolated either. Most of my \"activity\" was definitely academic-focused, especially in Sudikoff and Fairchild.\n\nThe upcoming deadlines are looming large. So many of them clustered on Monday and Tuesday next week, plus one on Wednesday. That's definitely contributing to the low sleep and the constant push to work. My stamina is at a 5, which is okay, but I can feel the cumulative effect of the late nights.\n\nChallenges? Definitely the sleep. And the internal debate about class attendance. I feel like I'm learning, but I also know I'm not engaging in the way I'm \"supposed\" to. It's a constant mental battle between what feels productive for *me* and what the syllabus dictates.\n\nFor next week, my goals are pretty clear:\n1.  **Prioritize sleep:** I need to figure out how to get more than 3 hours consistently. It's not sustainable.\n2.  **Re-evaluate class attendance:** Maybe I can make it to at least *some* of the lectures, even if it's just to check in or ask a quick question. It might help ease some of the neurotic anxiety.\n3.  **Tackle those deadlines head-on:** With so many due early next week, I need to be super organized and efficient. I've got the knowledge, now it's about execution.\n4.  **Maintain productivity:** Keep up the self-study and project work that's clearly helping me learn, but try to integrate it better with the official schedule.\n\nIt was a productive week in terms of learning, but a chaotic one in terms of routine.

On one hand, my happiness is surprisingly high, and my knowledge scores are still through the roof, which is a relief. But then I look at my sleep, and it's just abysmal. Three hours? No wonder I feel like I'm constantly running on fumes.\n\nThe biggest thing I need to confront is my class attendance. Looking at the schedule and my activity, I completely missed *all* my classes this week \u2013 COSC 065 and COSC 077. It's not like me to just skip, and the thought of falling behind is already making my neuroticism spike. Especially with so many deadlines looming next week; I've got a bunch of assignments due on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. My conscientiousness is practically screaming at me to get my act together.\n\nI think what happened was I got incredibly absorbed in some other work. Early Wednesday morning, I was in Sudikoff Hall, just completely in the zone, working on something that really captured my attention. The sensors might have said \"No activity,\" but my brain was definitely on overdrive. Then, for most of Thursday and Friday, I was practically living at the Boathouse. It's a bit of an unconventional study spot, but I found myself incredibly focused there, diving deep into a personal project. I was up at really odd hours \u2013 midnight, 3 AM, 11 PM \u2013 just completely immersed. That intense focus and the progress I was making on something I genuinely cared about probably explains why my happiness is still so high, even with the sleep deprivation and missed classes. It felt productive, almost exhilarating, but now the reality of those missed lectures is hitting me.\n\nThere were a couple of weird detours too, like a quick stop at the Admissions Office and even Hanover High School, which was totally random. And that pottery studio? No idea what that was about, probably just a sensor glitch or a quick errand. My social life felt pretty average, which is fine for me; I'm not the most extraverted person, so a moderate amount of interaction is usually enough.\n\nThe challenge now is to catch up. I know I have a strong grasp of the material generally, but translating that into actual assignment completion and understanding the specifics of what I missed in lectures is going to be crucial. My stamina feels okay for now, but I know this lack of sleep is going to catch up to me if I don't address it.\n\nSo, for next week, my goals are crystal clear:\n1.  **Prioritize sleep:** This is non-negotiable. I need to get more rest if I want to be effective and reduce this underlying anxiety.\n2.  **Attend all classes:** No more skipping. I need to be present, engaged, and actively participating.\n3.  **Tackle those deadlines head-on:** I'll break down the upcoming assignments and start chipping away at them immediately. I can't afford to fall any further behind.\n4.  **Review missed material:** I need to dedicate time to going through the lecture notes and readings for the classes I missed this week.\n\nIt's going to be a demanding week, but I'm determined to get back on track. I just need to channel that intense, almost obsessive focus I had at the Boathouse into my actual coursework.", "judge_reasoning": "```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- **Stamina:** Set low because the student states they are \"constantly running on fumes\" and acknowledges that the \"lack of sleep is going to catch up to me,\" despite feeling \"okay for now.\" This indicates a low underlying physical reserve.\n- **Knowledge:** Set high as the student explicitly mentions \"my knowledge scores are still through the roof\" and \"I know I have a strong grasp of the material generally.\"\n- **Stress:** Set high due to multiple indicators: \"the thought of falling behind is already making my neuroticism spike,\" \"so many deadlines looming next week,\" \"My conscientiousness is practically screaming at me,\" and the \"reality of those missed lectures is hitting me,\" along with a goal to \"reduce this underlying anxiety.\"\n- **Happy:** Set high because the student directly states \"my happiness is surprisingly high\" and \"my happiness is still so high,\" attributing it to feeling \"productive, almost exhilarating\" from a personal project.\n- **Sleep:** Set very low as the student describes their sleep as \"just abysmal.
