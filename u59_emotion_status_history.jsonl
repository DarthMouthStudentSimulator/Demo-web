Early mornings, late nights, just constant activity. It\u2019s been incredible, really. Being out on the water, pushing ourselves, the team camaraderie \u2013 it\u2019s just the best feeling. My stamina feels through the roof, which makes sense with all the training. And somehow, despite the crazy hours, I've actually been sleeping really well. I guess when you're that physically active, you just crash hard. It\u2019s been great connecting with everyone on the team, too. That social buzz is definitely keeping me going.\n\nBut, and this is a big \"but,\" it's also meant that my actual classes kind of\u2026 didn't happen this week. I saw the summary said \"no class experience recorded,\" and yeah, that's painfully accurate. Every time I was supposed to be in GERM 001, or COSC 065, or COSC 007, I was either already at the Boathouse, heading there, or just completely immersed in whatever we were doing. It\u2019s a bit of a wake-up call, to be honest. I mean, I love what I'm doing with the team, but I'm here for academics too, right?\n\nI'm starting to feel a little bit of stress creep in, especially looking at all those deadlines piling up. There are so many! I know I'm probably pretty behind in all my classes, especially COSC. It\u2019s not ideal, and I feel a bit bad about missing so much. I really need to get a handle on things before it becomes a massive problem. My knowledge levels are probably taking a hit right now, which is a bit concerning.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is to actually *go* to class. Like, physically be there. I need to figure out how to balance the intense Boathouse schedule with my academic commitments. I'm going to try and get ahead on readings and assignments, especially for COSC, and maybe even reach out to my professors or TAs to see what I missed. I also want to make sure I'm not just stuck in the Boathouse bubble; it would be good to branch out socially a bit more on campus.

Honestly, it was a bit of a whirlwind, but in a mostly good way. My energy levels are through the roof, and I've been feeling super happy and social, which is awesome. I guess all that time at the Boathouse really pays off, physically and mentally. Rowing just keeps me going, and being around the team is always a blast.\n\nNow, about classes... yeah, that's where things get a little fuzzy. Looking at my schedule and where I actually was, it's pretty clear I didn't make it to a lot of my lectures this week. German? Definitely missed a few. And COSC 065 and 007 too. I know, I know, not ideal. It's funny, my class experience summary says \"no class experience recorded,\" and honestly, that feels pretty accurate for the actual *in-class* experience.\n\nMost of my time was either at the Boathouse \u2013 seriously, it's like my second home \u2013 or, when I finally buckled down, in Sudikoff Hall. Friday night and pretty much all day Saturday were a blur of code and concepts in Sudikoff. Those COSC assignments are no joke, and when you're trying to catch up after missing lectures, it feels like you're learning everything for the first time. I feel like I have a decent grasp on things generally, but there are definitely some specific areas in COSC where I feel like I'm starting from scratch. That's probably why I was pulling those long hours.\n\nI did have a random trip to West Lebanon on Friday morning, just a quick errand, nothing exciting. But it meant I missed even more classes that day. And then Monday and Tuesday, it was back to the Boathouse for most of the morning, which meant more missed classes. I guess I just got a bit carried away with everything else.\n\nThe good news is, despite the academic juggling act, I'm feeling really good. My sleep has been solid, and my stamina is through the roof. I love being out on the water, and it's where I feel most alive. The social side of things is great too; I've been connecting with a lot of people, which always boosts my mood.\n\nThe challenge, obviously, is getting back on track with academics. I can see all these deadlines piling up, especially for Friday and Monday, and it's starting to feel a little overwhelming. I know I can't keep missing classes and expect to just magically absorb everything.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is to actually *be* in class. Seriously. I need to set alarms and make sure I'm in Dartmouth Hall for German, and in LSB and Baker-Berry for COSC. I also want to try and get a head start on assignments instead of leaving them until the last minute and pulling all-nighters in Sudikoff. It's all about finding that balance, right? I want to keep up with rowing and my social life, because those are so important for my well-being, but I also need to make sure my grades don't suffer. Maybe I can even find a study group for COSC 007 to help solidify those trickier concepts.

My sleep has been solid, and I've been super social, which always makes me happy.\n\nA huge chunk of my week, as usual, was spent down at the Boathouse. Seriously, it's like my second home. I was there practically every day, from early mornings on Saturday and Sunday, to late nights on Thursday and Friday. There was so much activity there, and it just feels so good to be out on the water or just hanging out with everyone. It's definitely where I get a lot of my stamina from, and it's such a great group of people.

Looking back, I barely made it to any of my actual classes this week, which is a bit of a wake-up call. I mean, I was in Reed Hall on Thursday for COSC 065, which was good, but I completely missed German every day, and the other COSC classes too. It's funny, I was in classrooms a few times, like on Wednesday and Friday, and even Monday and Tuesday, but I wasn't actually *in* class, if that makes sense. More like just in the building, maybe trying to catch up on my own.\n\nI did spend a ton of time in Sudikoff Hall on Monday and Tuesday, especially Tuesday morning. I was there for hours, just trying to wrap my head around some of the COSC concepts. And I hit up Baker-Berry Library on Friday and Monday too, trying to get some work done. So it's not like I wasn't thinking about academics, but the actual class attendance just didn't happen. My knowledge score definitely reflects that, which is a bit concerning.

I need to make it to German every morning, no excuses, and get to all my COSC lectures. I also need to dedicate specific, focused time to catching up on the material I missed, especially in COSC, because those deadlines are coming fast. I'm going to try to use my time in the library and Sudikoff more effectively, maybe even find a study group.

Honestly, I feel pretty great. My energy levels are super high, and I've been getting a ton of sleep, which is awesome. And my social battery is definitely full \u2013 I've been hanging out with friends a lot, which always makes me happy.\n\nThis week was, well, a lot of boathouse time, as usual! Those early morning sessions are brutal to wake up for, but once I'm out on the water, it's just the best feeling. It really sets the tone for the day, and I can feel how much stronger I'm getting. It's probably why my stamina is so good right now. I even managed to squeeze in some late-night sessions too, which is a testament to how much I love being out there.\n\nAcademically, though, I need to be real with myself. My class attendance wasn't exactly stellar. I think I only made it to one COSC 065 lecture on Thursday, and even then, it was in Reed Hall, not LSB, so I must have been a bit off my game. German? Yeah, I definitely didn't make it to any of those. It's tough when practice is so demanding and then I just want to crash or hang out with people. I did try to get some work done in Fairchild and Sudikoff a couple of evenings, which felt productive, but I know it's not the same as being in class. My knowledge stat is definitely reflecting that, which is a bit concerning.\n\nLooking at all these deadlines piling up, especially for Friday and Monday, it's a little overwhelming. I've got so many things due! It's that familiar feeling of \"oh crap, I really need to get on top of this.\" I'm usually pretty good about getting things done, but this week I let the social stuff and rowing take over a bit too much.\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is to really buckle down on academics. I need to make a conscious effort to get to all my classes, especially German \u2013 I don't want to fall too far behind. And those COSC assignments are going to require some serious focus. I'm going to try to schedule dedicated study blocks in the library or Sudikoff and actually stick to them, even if it means saying no to some spontaneous hangouts. I know I can balance everything, I just need to be more disciplined about it.

Seriously, I feel like I'm absolutely thriving right now. My energy levels are through the roof, I'm sleeping great, and I've been having such an amazing time with everyone. My social battery is definitely fully charged, which is awesome.\n\nThe biggest highlight, hands down, was all the time I spent at the Boathouse. It feels like my second home, honestly. I was there practically every day, getting in some serious activity. Wednesday and Thursday afternoons were great, and then again on Friday evening. Saturday was a solid block of time there too, and even Sunday night I found myself back there. And Monday morning, bright and early, I was back at it! It's just such a fantastic way to clear my head and push myself. I love the feeling of being out on the water, and the team vibe is just incredible. It's where I feel most alive, you know?\n\nBecause of all that, I have to admit, my class attendance wasn't exactly stellar this week. I saw the schedule, and I know I had German and both COSC classes, but somehow, the week just flew by with so much else going on. It's funny, I did pop into Reed Hall for a bit on Friday, just trying to get some work done, and I even made it over to Sudikoff on Monday afternoon, which felt productive. But yeah, the actual lectures? Not so much. It's a bit of a bummer because I *do* want to learn, but sometimes it feels like there just aren't enough hours in the day to do everything I want to do.\n\nBeyond the Boathouse, my social life was buzzing! Sunday night was super fun, grabbing a late dinner at the Commons with friends. And going to the Hopkins Center for the Arts on Sunday evening was such a cool experience \u2013 I love checking out new performances and just soaking in the culture. Then, Tuesday night got a little wild, ending up at the Sphinx Secret Society. It was definitely an interesting night, full of good conversations and laughs. I also found myself at the Admissions Office a couple of times, which was unexpected but actually pretty cool. I just love being around people and seeing what's happening on campus.\n\nLooking back, I'm super happy with how much I engaged with my passions and my friends. My stamina is great, and I feel really connected to the community here. The only tiny little voice in the back of my head is about those classes. I know I've got a bunch of deadlines coming up, especially for Friday and Monday, and I haven't really been keeping up with the material. My knowledge stats are probably reflecting that!\n\nSo, for next week, my main goal is definitely to find a better balance. I want to keep up with my Boathouse routine because it's so important to me, but I *really* need to make it to my classes. I'm going to set alarms for them and try to get myself to Dartmouth Hall, LSB, and Baker-Berry. I also need to dedicate some solid time to catching up on readings and getting a head start on those assignments. I'm feeling good, so I think I can totally tackle it. It's all about finding that sweet spot between crushing it in my activities and staying on top of my academics.

It's been a whirlwind of activity, and I've loved every minute of it.\n\nI spent a ton of time down at the Boathouse this week. Seriously, it feels like my second home. Got some good sessions in on Wednesday morning and then again early Friday. It's just such a great way to start the day, or even just to clear my head. I also had a really fun dinner at the 53 Commons on Wednesday night \u2013 always good to catch up with everyone there. Thursday was a bit of a blur, but I ended up back at Parker House late, just hanging out with friends. And Friday night? That was epic. Started off at the Hopkins Center, which was cool, then somehow ended up at McNutt Hall for a bit, and then the rest of the night was just pure social chaos, in the best way possible. I think I was out until like 3 AM on Saturday, just bouncing around with people. My social life is definitely thriving!\n\nThe only thing is, looking back, I think I might have gotten a *little* carried away with all the fun. My classes kind of\u2026 well, they didn't really happen this week, did they? I mean, I was in the general vicinity of LSB and Baker-Berry a few times, but I definitely didn't make it to any of my COSC or GERM classes.

I've got a bunch of deadlines coming up, particularly for Monday and Friday, so I really need to buckle down and start chipping away at those assignments.
