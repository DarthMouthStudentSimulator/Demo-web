I didn't make it to any of them this week. Not BIOL, not COSC 050, not COSC 065. I know, I know. It\u2019s bad. Every morning, I\u2019d wake up, feeling surprisingly rested, actually \u2013 my sleep tracker says I\u2019m getting plenty of sleep, which is weird because my brain feels anything but rested. I\u2019d just\u2026 stay in Parker House. The thought of getting up, getting ready, and going to a lecture, especially knowing how much I\u2019m already behind, just felt impossible. It\u2019s like this heavy blanket of dread just keeps me glued to my bed. I\u2019d tell myself I\u2019d catch up later, or just read the notes, but then later never really comes. It\u2019s frustrating, because I *want* to learn, I really do. But the inertia is just so strong.\n\nI spent a lot of time just\u2026 existing in my dorm. Or wandering. I found myself down at the Boathouse a lot. It\u2019s peaceful there, just watching the water. It\u2019s a good escape from the constant hum of anxiety in my head. I went there early in the morning a couple of times, and then again in the evenings. It\u2019s a quiet place, and I don\u2019t really have to talk to anyone. I guess that\u2019s good, because I haven\u2019t really been feeling up to much social interaction. My social battery feels pretty neutral, but I haven't really pushed it. Just quick trips to the dining hall for food, mostly.\n\nI also ended up near the Admissions Office a few times, and the Life Sciences Center, and even the Hopkins Center.

Oh god, the deadlines. There are so many of them, just piling up. Sunday has two, Monday has three, Tuesday has four, and then more later in the week. It\u2019s like a wall of assignments, and I haven\u2019t even started chipping away at it. My knowledge level feels stagnant, which is probably accurate since I haven't been absorbing anything new in class. I feel this constant pressure, this tightness in my chest, and it just makes me want to retreat even more. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. I know I should be working, but the sheer volume of it just paralyzes me. I'm not happy about it, but it's hard to break out of.\n\nI really need to turn things around. My goal for next week, and I really mean it this time, is to actually *go* to my classes. All of them. Even if I feel lost, I need to be there. And I need to start tackling these deadlines, one by one. I need to break them down into smaller, manageable pieces, instead of just staring at the whole mountain. Maybe I can try to find a study buddy, or at least someone to just sit with in the library, so I feel a bit more accountable.

Not sure why, maybe just wandering, or trying to feel like I was doing *something* official, even if it wasn't class. It\u2019s a strange place to gravitate towards when you\u2019re already a student. And the boathouse\u2026 I went there a few times too. It\u2019s quiet, I guess.

My sleep has been surprisingly good, and my stamina is high, so it\u2019s not a physical exhaustion, it\u2019s purely mental.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to get back to class. That's the absolute top priority. I need to force myself to go, even if I just sit there and absorb a fraction of it. I also need to pick *one* deadline, just one, and focus on getting it done, rather than looking at the whole terrifying list. Maybe the one due Saturday, just to get a win.

I'm up so late, then I just crash, and then I can't get myself to wake up for anything important. It's a vicious cycle.

It's overwhelming. I feel like I know so much, but then I feel like I know nothing at all, especially after missing all those lectures.\n\nI really need to get it together. For next week, my main goal, my *only* goal, is to actually *go* to class. Just show up. Even if I feel completely lost, I need to be there. And I need to figure out what's going on with me and 6 Maynard Street, because it's clearly not helping. I also need to try and tackle at least one of those looming assignments, just to feel like I'm not completely drowning. It's going to be hard, I know it will be, but I can't keep doing this.

It feels like they just blur into each other sometimes, especially when I look back and try to figure out what actually happened. My mood tracker says I'm pretty happy, like an 8, which is... good? I guess? But honestly, there's this constant hum of anxiety under everything, especially when I think about classes.\n\nSpeaking of classes, this week was a bit of a disaster on that front. I didn't make it to any of them. Not BIOL, not COSC 050, not COSC 065. I know, I know. It's ridiculous. I'd wake up, or rather, *not* wake up, and then the thought of getting ready and going just felt like too much. Or I'd be up super late, like that one night I was at Sudikoff trying to get something done for COSC, and then the morning just hits you like a brick wall. I feel like I understand the material, my knowledge score is high, but actually *showing up* and *doing* the work on time? That's where I completely fall apart. It's so frustrating because I *want* to do well, but the motivation just evaporates when it's time to actually execute.\n\nAnd the deadlines! Oh my god, the deadlines. There are so many coming up. Sunday had two, Monday had four, Tuesday has five. Just looking at that list makes my stomach clench. I tried to get some stuff done, like that late night at Sudikoff on Monday, but it feels like I'm always playing catch-up. I spent a lot of time at Parker House or Goldstein, just... existing. And 6 Maynard Street, too. It's nice to have places to just chill, but I know I should have been in class.\n\nMy sleep schedule is completely messed up. I was up at 2 AM, 3 AM, 4 AM multiple times this week, sometimes at the Boathouse, sometimes just wandering around, or at 6 Maynard. Then I'd crash for hours. It's probably why I can't get myself out of bed for morning classes. I love being by the water at the Boathouse, it's a good escape, and hanging out at 6 Maynard is always chill. I guess those are my social outlets, which is fine, but I wonder if they're also contributing to the chaos. My social score is average, which feels about right. I'm not a huge party person, but I like having a few places to go.\n\nThe biggest challenge is definitely getting myself to be more disciplined. I feel this immense pressure from all the assignments piling up, and it just makes me want to avoid everything even more. It's a vicious cycle. I feel happy when I'm not thinking about it, but the second I do, the anxiety just floods in.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to do better. My main goal is to actually attend my classes. All of them. Even if I'm tired, I need to just get myself there. I also need to try and fix my sleep schedule. No more 4 AM adventures, hopefully. And I need to start tackling those deadlines *before* the last minute. I know I have the knowledge, I just need to figure out how to actually apply it consistently.

And honestly, it feels like it just\u2026 happened. Like I was floating through it, barely touching down. My head feels so heavy, and my eyes are just burning. Sleep, or the lack of it, is really starting to catch up to me. I mean, ten hours for the whole week? That's just not sustainable. I keep telling myself I'll get to bed earlier, but then it's suddenly 2 AM and I'm still trying to figure out that COSC problem or just staring at the ceiling. I remember being at Parker House super late, and then the boathouse? What was I even doing there at 2 AM on Friday? It's all a blur.\n\nAnd because of that, everything else just feels like it's crumbling. I missed so many classes this week. *All* of them, actually. BIOL, COSC 050, COSC 065\u2026 every single one. I was just\u2026 not there. Or I was in my dorm, or at that private residence on Maynard, just trying to exist. The thought of going to class, sitting there, trying to absorb information when my brain feels like static, it just felt impossible. The guilt is eating at me, though. I know I *should* be there. I know I'm paying for these classes. It's just so hard to drag myself out of bed, let alone focus. My stamina is practically non-existent.\n\nIt's weird, because I feel like I *know* a lot of the material, or at least I did before this week. But now, with all the missed lectures, I feel like I'm falling behind, and that just makes the anxiety worse. There are so many deadlines coming up \u2013 Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, it's just a constant wave. I spent some time at Sudikoff trying to catch up on Saturday night, and then again on Tuesday, but it feels like I'm just treading water.\n\nI did manage to get out a bit, which was nice, I guess. Saw a movie at the Nugget, and then went to the Hopkins Center for something. And the Sphinx Society, that was\u2026 interesting. It's good to have those moments, to feel like a normal person for a bit, but even those feel like they drain me more than they recharge me. My social battery is just so low. I try to be agreeable and present, but inside, I'm just screaming for a quiet corner.\n\nThis cycle of not sleeping, missing classes, feeling guilty, and then getting more anxious about the deadlines is just\u2026 a lot. I feel like I'm constantly on the verge of tears, or just completely numb. My happiness is definitely taking a hit.\n\nNext week, I *have* to do better. My main goal is just to *show up*. To every single class. Even if I just sit there and absorb a fraction of it, it's better than nothing. And sleep. I need to prioritize sleep. Maybe if I get more sleep, I'll have the energy to actually go to class, and then maybe I won't feel so overwhelmed by everything. I need to break this cycle. I just don't know how yet.

Mostly a blur of anxiety and exhaustion. My head feels so heavy, and my eyes just want to stay closed. Looking back, it's pretty clear why.\n\nI didn't make it to a single class this week. Not one. BIOL, COSC 050, COSC 065 \u2013 all of them just\u2026 passed by while I was either still in my dorm at Goldstein Hall or back at 6 Maynard. It's this awful feeling, knowing I *should* be there, knowing I'm paying for it, and just not being able to drag myself out of bed. The guilt is a constant hum in the background, making it even harder to focus on anything else. My conscientiousness is clearly in the gutter right now.\n\nThe main reason, I think, is the Boathouse. I was there so late, or so early, almost every night. Thursday, Friday, Saturday \u2013 1 AM, 2 AM, even 3 AM. It's intense, and it completely wrecks my sleep schedule. My sleep stat is at a 5, and honestly, it feels generous. My stamina is also at a 5, which makes sense because I'm just running on fumes. It's hard to feel happy when you're this tired and stressed, so that 15 for happiness isn't surprising.\n\nEven though I'm at the Boathouse, my social score is still pretty low. I'm not really out there socializing much beyond the immediate activity. I tend to keep to myself, and when I'm this drained, the thought of engaging with people just feels like too much. I just want to retreat into my own space.\n\nThe knowledge stats are high, which is weird, because I feel like I'm absorbing nothing right now. Maybe it's just raw intelligence, but it's not translating into actual academic engagement. I know the material is there, but getting myself to *do* anything with it is the problem.\n\nAnd then there are the deadlines. So many deadlines. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday. It's just a wall of assignments, and I haven't even started on most of them. The thought of it makes my stomach clench. It's this constant, overwhelming dread that just paralyzes me. My neuroticism is definitely through the roof.\n\nI keep wondering if there's a better way to manage all this. I mean, I *want* to do well. I want to be a good student. I feel bad for not being present, for potentially letting myself down, or even my professors. It's just that the energy isn't there.\n\nFor next week, I *have* to get to class. That's the absolute top priority. I need to figure out how to balance the Boathouse with my academics, or something's going to break. I also desperately need to catch up on sleep. Maybe if I can get a few solid nights of rest, I'll have the stamina to actually tackle those deadlines.
